-- 			global or local to window |global-local|
-- 	Characters to fill the statuslines, vertical separators and special

-- 	It is a comma-separated list of items.  Each item has a name, a colon
-- 	and the value of that item:
-- 
-- 	  item		default		Used for ~
-- 	  stl		' ' or `'^'` 	statusline of the current window
-- 	  stlnc		' ' or `'='` 	statusline of the non-current windows
-- 	  wbr		' '		window bar

-- 
-- 	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
-- 	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, `'^'`  or `'='` 
-- 	otherwise.
-- 
-- 	Note that "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown", "vertleft", "vertright" and
-- 	"verthoriz" are only used when `'laststatus'`  is 3, since only vertical
-- 	window separators are used otherwise.
-- 
-- 	If `'ambiwidth'`  is "double" then "horiz", "horizup", "horizdown",
-- 	"vert", "vertleft", "vertright", "verthoriz", "foldsep" and "fold"
-- 	default to single-byte alternatives.
-- 
-- 	Example: >
-- 	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:│,fold:·,diff:-
-- <	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
-- 	be used when there is highlighting.
-- 
-- 	For the "stl", "stlnc", "foldopen", "foldclose" and "foldsep" items
-- 	single-byte and multibyte characters are supported.  But double-width
-- 	characters are not supported.

-- 			local to window
-- 	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in `'breakat'`  rather

-- 	`'wrapmargin'`  and `'textwidth'` , this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
-- 	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
-- 	If `'breakindent'`  is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
-- 	of `'showbreak'`  is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
-- 	is not used when the `'wrap'`  option is off.

-- 	the `'listchars'`  option.
-- 
-- 	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
-- 	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
-- 	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
-- 		:set list lcs=tab:\ \
-- <
-- 	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with `'textwidth'`

-- 
-- 
-- 	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
-- 			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
-- 			line.
-- 
-- 	  tab:xy[z]	Two or three characters to be used to show a tab.
-- 			The third character is optional.
-- 
-- 	  tab:xy	The `'x'`  is always used, then `'y'`  as many times as will
-- 			fit.  Thus "tab:>-" displays:
-- 				>
-- 				>-
-- 				>--
-- 				etc.
-- 
-- 	  tab:xyz	The `'z'`  is always used, then `'x'`  is prepended, and
-- 			then `'y'`  is used as many times as will fit.  Thus
-- 			"tab:<->" displays:
-- 				>
-- 				<>
-- 				<->
-- 				<-->
-- 				etc.
-- 
-- 			When "tab:" is omitted, a tab is shown as ^I.
-- 
-- 	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
-- 			are left blank.
-- 
-- 	  multispace:c...
-- 	 		One or more characters to use cyclically to show for
-- 	 		multiple consecutive spaces.  Overrides the "space"
-- 			setting, except for single spaces.  When omitted, the
-- 			"space" setting is used.  For example,
-- 			`:set listchars=multispace:---+` shows ten consecutive
-- 			spaces as:
-- 				---+---+-- ~
-- 
-- 	  lead:c	Character to show for leading spaces.  When omitted,
-- 			leading spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
-- 			"multispace" settings for leading spaces.  You can
-- 			combine it with "tab:", for example: >
-- 				:set listchars+=tab:>-,lead:.
-- <
-- 	  leadmultispace:c...
-- 			Like the |lcs-multispace| value, but for leading
-- 			spaces only.  Also overrides |lcs-lead| for leading
-- 			multiple spaces.
-- 			`:set listchars=leadmultispace:---+` shows ten
-- 			consecutive leading spaces as:
-- 				---+---+--XXX ~
-- 			Where "XXX" denotes the first non-blank characters in
-- 			the line.
-- 
-- 	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
-- 			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space" and
-- 			"multispace" settings for trailing spaces.
-- 
-- 	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when `'wrap'`  is
-- 			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
-- 			screen.
-- 
-- 	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first visible column of the
-- 			physical line, when there is text preceding the
-- 			character visible in the first column.
-- 
-- 	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
-- 			`'conceallevel'`  is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
-- 
-- 	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
-- 			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
-- 			omitted.
-- 
-- 	The characters `':'`  and `','`  should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
-- 	be used.  All characters must be single width.
-- 
-- 	Each character can be specified as hex: >
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\x24
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
-- 		set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
-- <	Note that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters
-- 	must be exactly 2 for \\x, 4 for \\u and 8 for \\U.
-- 
-- 	Examples: >
-- 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
-- 	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
-- 	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
-- <	|hl-NonText| highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and

vim.wo.listchars = "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+"
-- `'number'`  `'nu'` 		boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the `'n'`  option is
-- 	excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped line will not use the column of
-- 	line numbers.
-- 	Use the `'numberwidth'`  option to adjust the room for the line number.
-- 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
-- 	characters are put before the number.
-- 	For highlighting see |hl-LineNr|, |hl-CursorLineNr|, and the
-- 	|:sign-define| "numhl" argument.
-- 
-- 	The `'relativenumber'`  option changes the displayed number to be
-- 	relative to the cursor.  Together with `'number'`  there are these
-- 	four combinations (cursor in line 3):
-- 
-- 		`'nonu'`           `'nu'`             `'nonu'`           `'nu'` 
-- 		`'nornu'`          `'nornu'`          `'rnu'`            `'rnu'`

vim.wo.number = "false"
-- `'numberwidth'`  `'nuw'` 	number	(default: 4)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
-- 	when the `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'`  option is set or printing lines
-- 	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
-- 	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
-- 	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
-- 	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
-- 	rows in the window, depending on whether `'number'`  or `'relativenumber'` 
-- 	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
-- 	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.

vim.wo.numberwidth = "4"
-- `'previewwindow'`  `'pvw'` 	boolean (default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option

vim.wo.previewwindow = "false"
-- `'relativenumber'`  `'rnu'` 	boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
-- 	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
-- 	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
-- 	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
-- 	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
-- 	When the `'n'`  option is excluded from `'cpoptions'`  a wrapped
-- 	line will not use the column of line numbers.
-- 	The `'numberwidth'`  option can be used to set the room used for the line
-- 	number.
-- 	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, `'-'` 
-- 	characters are put before the number.
-- 	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
-- 	the number.

vim.wo.relativenumber = "false"
-- `'rightleft'`  `'rl'` 	boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to window
-- 	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
-- 	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
-- 	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
-- 	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
-- 	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
-- 	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
-- 	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left

-- `'scroll'`  `'scr'` 		number	(default: half the window height)
-- 			local to window
-- 	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
-- 	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
-- 	changes.  This may happen when enabling the |status-line| or
-- 	`'tabline'`  option after setting the `'scroll'`  option.
-- 	If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will

-- 	differences between two versions of a file, see `'diff'` .
-- 	See |`'scrollopt'` | for options that determine how this option should be
-- 	interpreted.
-- 	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another

-- 	value greater than 0 while having |`'sidescroll'` | also at a non-zero
-- 	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
-- 	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
-- 	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
-- 	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too

-- 
-- 	Note regarding 'orphaned signs': with signcolumn numbers higher than

-- 	Also see |status-line|.
-- 
-- 	The option consists of printf style `'%'`  items interspersed with
-- 	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
-- 	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
-- 	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
-- 	be given as "%%".
-- 
-- 	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
-- 	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
-- 		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
-- <	The  variable will be set to the |window-ID| of the
-- 	window that the status line belongs to.
-- 	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
-- 	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
-- 	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
-- 	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.
-- 
-- 	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
-- 	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.
-- 
-- 	Note that the only effect of `'ruler'`  when this option is set (and
-- 	`'laststatus'`  is 2 or 3) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.
-- 
-- 	field	    meaning ~
-- 	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
-- 		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
-- 	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by `'-'` .
-- 	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by `'-'`  & `'0'` .
-- 		    Value must be 50 or less.
-- 	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a `'<'` 
-- 		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
-- 		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by `'>'` number
-- 		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
-- 		    an exponential notation.
-- 	item	    A one letter code as described below.
-- 
-- 	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
-- 	second character in "item" is the type:
-- 		N for number
-- 		S for string
-- 		F for flags as described below
-- 		- not applicable
-- 
-- 	item  meaning ~
-- 	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
-- 	      directory.
-- 	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
-- 	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
-- 	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if `'modifiable'`  is off.
-- 	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
-- 	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
-- 	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
-- 	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
-- 	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
-- 	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
-- 	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
-- 	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See `'filetype'` .
-- 	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See `'filetype'` .
-- 	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
-- 	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or `'keymap'`  when |:lmap| mappings are
-- 	      being used: "<keymap>"
-- 	n N   Buffer number.
-- 	b N   Value of character under cursor.
-- 	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
-- 	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
-- 	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
-- 	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
-- 	N N   Printer page number.  (Only works in the `'printheader'`  option.)
-- 	l N   Line number.
-- 	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
-- 	c N   Column number (byte index).
-- 	v N   Virtual column number (screen column).
-- 	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to `'c'` .
-- 	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
-- 	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
-- 	      percentage described for `'ruler'` .  Always 3 in length, unless
-- 	      translated.
-- 	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
-- 	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
-- 	{ NF  Evaluate expression between `'%{'`  and `'}'`  and substitute result.
-- 	      Note that there is no `'%'`  before the closing `'}'` .  The
-- 	      expression cannot contain a `'}'`  character, call a function to
-- 	      work around that.  See |stl-%{| below.
-- 	{% -  This is almost same as { except the result of the expression is
-- 	      re-evaluated as a statusline format string.  Thus if the
-- 	      return value of expr contains % items they will get expanded.
-- 	      The expression can contain the } character, the end of
-- 	      expression is denoted by %}.
-- 	      For example: >
-- 		func! Stl_filename() abort
-- 		    return "%t"
-- 		endfunc
-- <	        `stl=%{Stl_filename()}`   results in `"%t"`
-- 	        `stl=%{%Stl_filename()%}` results in `"Name of current file"`
-- 	%} -  End of `{%` expression
-- 	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
-- 	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
-- 	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
-- 	T N   For `'tabline'` : start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end
-- 	      the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches
-- 	      to the specified tab page.
-- 	X N   For `'tabline'` : start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end
-- 	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current
-- 	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes
-- 	      specified tab page.
-- 	@ N   Start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to
-- 	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this
-- 	      label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once
-- 	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, `'l'` ,
-- 	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the
-- 	      following arguments in order:
-- 	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
-- 	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
-- 	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle
-- 	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument
-- 	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value
-- 	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected
-- 	         for other mouse buttons
-- 	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift
-- 	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m"
-- 	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string
-- 	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence
-- 	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to
-- 	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed
-- 	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per
-- 	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence
-- 	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was
-- 	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on
-- 	         this label.
-- 	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
-- 	      No width fields allowed.
-- 	= -   Separation point between alignment sections. Each section will
-- 	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.
-- 	      No width fields allowed.
-- 	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
-- 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
-- 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
-- 	      windows.
-- 	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
-- 	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
-- 	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
-- 	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
-- 	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|
-- 
-- 	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
-- 	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
-- 	when flags are used like in the examples below.
-- 
-- 	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
-- 	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
-- 	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
-- 	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
-- 		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
-- <	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
-- 	line is displayed.
-- 
-- 	While evaluating %{} the current buffer and current window will be set
-- 	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
-- 	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
-- 	The variable "g:actual_curbuf" is set to the `bufnr()` number of the
-- 	real current buffer and "g:actual_curwin" to the |window-ID| of the
-- 	real current window.  These values are strings.
-- 
-- 	The `'statusline'`  option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
-- 	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
-- 	This option cannot be set in a modeline when `'modelineexpr'`  is off.
-- 
-- 	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
-- 	evaluating `'statusline'`  |textlock|.
-- 
-- 	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
-- 	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
-- 	using `:redrawstatus`.
-- 
-- 	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
-- 	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
-- 	described above.
-- 
-- 	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
-- 	If you are stuck, hold down `':'`  or `'Q'`  to get a prompt, then quit and
-- 	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim --clean" to get it right.
-- 
-- 	Examples:
-- 	Emulate standard status line with `'ruler'`  set >
-- 	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
-- <	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
-- 	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
-- <	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >

-- 
-- 	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is

-- 	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
-- 	editing a table.
-- 	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
-- 	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
-- 	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
-- 	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
-- 	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
-- 	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
-- 	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
-- 	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
-- 	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
-- 	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will

-- `'backupcopy'`  `'bkc'` 	string	(default: "auto")
-- 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
-- 	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
-- 	done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
-- 
-- 	The main values are:
-- 	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
-- 	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
-- 	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best
-- 
-- 	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
-- 	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
-- 	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
-- 
-- 	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
-- 	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
-- 	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
-- 	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
-- 	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
-- 	  not of the real file.
-- 
-- 	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
-- 	+ It's fast.
-- 	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
-- 	  file.
-- 	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
-- 
-- 	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
-- 	file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
-- 	and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
-- 	a copy will be made.
-- 
-- 	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
-- 	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
-- 	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
-- 	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
-- 	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
-- 	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
-- 	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
-- 	be propagated back to the original source.
-- 
-- 	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
-- 	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
-- 	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
-- 	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
-- 	example.
-- 
-- 	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
-- 	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
-- 	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
-- 	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
-- 	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
-- 	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
-- 	others.
-- 
-- 	When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
-- 	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
-- 	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
-- 	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
-- 	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
-- 	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
-- 	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
-- 	again not rename the file.
vim.bo.backupcopy = "auto"
-- `'binary'`  `'bin'` 		boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to buffer
-- 	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
-- 	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
-- 	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
-- 		`'textwidth'`   will be set to 0
-- 		`'wrapmargin'`  will be set to 0
-- 		`'modeline'`    will be off
-- 		`'expandtab'`   will be off
-- 	Also, `'fileformat'`  and `'fileformats'`  options will not be used, the
-- 	file is read and written like `'fileformat'`  was "unix" (a single <NL>
-- 	separates lines).
-- 	The `'fileencoding'`  and `'fileencodings'`  options will not be used, the
-- 	file is read without conversion.
-- 	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the `'bin'`  option is
-- 	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
-- 	`'textwidth'` ), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
-- 	`'bin'`  again when the file has been loaded.
-- 	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
-- 	`'bin'`  is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
-- 	saved option values.
-- 	To edit a file with `'binary'`  set you can use the |++bin| argument.
-- 	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
-- 	files you edit.
-- 	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
-- 	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
-- 	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
-- 	the `'endofline'`  option.
vim.bo.binary = "false"
-- `'bomb'` 			boolean	(default off)
-- 			local to buffer
-- 	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
-- 	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
-- 	- this option is on
-- 	- the `'binary'`  option is off
-- 	- `'fileencoding'`  is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
-- 	  endian variants.
-- 	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
-- 	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
-- 	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
-- 	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
-- 	When Vim reads a file and `'fileencodings'`  starts with "ucs-bom", a
-- 	check for the presence of the BOM is done and `'bomb'`  set accordingly.
-- 	Unless `'binary'`  is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
-- 	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
-- 	will be restored when writing the file.

-- 
-- 	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!
-- 	One such effect is that Vim will not check the timestamp of the file,
-- 	if the file is changed by another program this will not be noticed.
-- 
-- 	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
-- 	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and

-- 
-- 	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
-- 	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
-- 			work (":w filename" does work though).
-- 	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |`'modified'` |.
-- 			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
-- 			example when you quit Vim.
-- 	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
-- 			(when `'swapfile'`  has been reset there is never a swap
-- 			file).
-- 	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
-- 			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
-- 			command.
-- 	both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
-- 			the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
-- 			triggered as usual for |:edit|.
-- 
-- 	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
-- 	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
-- 	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
-- 	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,

-- 		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
-- 	bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
-- 		considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
-- 		"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
-- 	unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
-- 		leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
-- 		the number.  Examples:
-- 		    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
-- 		    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
-- 		    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"

-- 		    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
-- 		    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.

-- 	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|

-- 	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
-- 
-- 	It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
-- 	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using

-- 	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
-- 	you: Using the first directory in `'runtimepath'`  that is writable.  If
-- 	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
-- 	name the first language name that appears in `'spelllang'`  is used,
-- 	ignoring the region.
-- 	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
-- 	have to appear in `'spelllang'` .
-- 	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
-- 	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
-- 	`'spellfile'`  is set to it, for entries in `'spelllang'`  only files
-- 	without region name will be found.
-- 	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for

-- 		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
-- <	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
-- 	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
-- 	The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
-- 	an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
-- 	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
-- 	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
-- 	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
-- 	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
-- 	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
-- 	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
-- 	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
-- 	en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
-- 	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
-- 	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
-- 	words.
-- 	Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
-- 	example of a longer name.
-- 
-- 	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
-- 	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
-- 	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
-- 	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
-- 	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
-- 	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.
-- 
-- 	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
-- 	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in `'runtimepath'`  the plugin
-- 	will ask you if you want to download the file.
-- 
-- 	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
-- 	"spell/LANG.vim" in `'runtimepath'` .  "LANG" is the value of `'spelllang'`

-- 	Careful: All text will be in memory:

-- 		- Recovery will be impossible!
-- 	A swapfile will only be present when |`'updatecount'` | is non-zero and

-- 	When `'swapfile'`  is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
-- 	immediately deleted.  When `'swapfile'`  is set, and `'updatecount'`  is
-- 	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
-- 	Also see |swap-file|.
-- 	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
-- 	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.

-- 	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
-- 	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file:
-- 		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */ ~
-- 	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
-- 	names.  Example:
-- 		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */ ~
-- 	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
-- 	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
-- 	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
-- 	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
-- 		:set syntax=OFF
-- <	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
-- 	`'filetype'`  option: >
-- 		:set syntax=ON
-- <	What actually happens when setting the `'syntax'`  option is that the
-- 	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
-- 	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the `'s'`  or

-- `'tabstop'`  `'ts'` 		number	(default 8)

-- 
-- 	Note: Setting `'tabstop'`  to any other value than 8 can make your file
-- 	appear wrong in many places, e.g., when printing it.
-- 	The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
-- 
-- 	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
-- 	1. Always keep `'tabstop'`  at 8, set `'softtabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to 4
-- 	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use `'noexpandtab'` .  Then Vim
-- 	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
-- 	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
-- 	2. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use
-- 	   `'expandtab'` .  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
-- 	   formatting will never be messed up when `'tabstop'`  is changed.
-- 	3. Set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to whatever you prefer and use a
-- 	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
-- 	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
-- 	4. Always set `'tabstop'`  and `'shiftwidth'`  to the same value, and
-- 	   `'noexpandtab'` .  This should then work (for initial indents only)
-- 	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
-- 	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
-- 	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when `'tabstop'`  is
-- 	   changed.
-- 
-- 	The value of `'tabstop'`  will be ignored if |`'vartabstop'` | is set to

-- 	of the current file.  But only when the `'d'`  flag is not included in
-- 	`'cpoptions'` .  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
-- 	|tags-option|.
-- 	"*", "" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
-- 	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib//tags" will
-- 	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
-- 	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib//tags?" will find
-- 	files called "tags?".
-- 	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
-- 	actually used.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
