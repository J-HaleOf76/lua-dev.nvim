-- Add a callback function that will be invoked when changes have
-- 		been made to buffer {buf}.
-- 		{buf} refers to a buffer name or number. For the accepted
-- 		values, see |bufname()|.  When {buf} is omitted the current
-- 		buffer is used.
-- 		Returns a unique ID that can be passed to |listener_remove()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with five arguments:
-- 		    a:bufnr	the buffer that was changed
-- 		    a:start	first changed line number
-- 		    a:end	first line number below the change
-- 		    a:added	number of lines added, negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    a:changes	a List of items with details about the changes
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 	    func Listener(bufnr, start, end, added, changes)
-- 	      echo 'lines ' .. a:start .. ' until ' .. a:end .. ' changed'
-- 	    endfunc
-- 	    call listener_add('Listener', bufnr)
--
-- <		The List cannot be changed.  Each item in a:changes is a
-- 		dictionary with these entries:
-- 		    lnum	the first line number of the change
-- 		    end		the first line below the change
-- 		    added	number of lines added; negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    col		first column in "lnum" that was affected by
-- 				the change; one if unknown or the whole line
-- 				was affected; this is a byte index, first
-- 				character has a value of one.
-- 		When lines are inserted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	line above which the new line is added
-- 		    end		equal to "lnum"
-- 		    added	number of lines inserted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are deleted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	the first deleted line
-- 		    end		the line below the first deleted line, before
-- 				the deletion was done
-- 		    added	negative, number of lines deleted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are changed:
-- 		    lnum	the first changed line
-- 		    end		the line below the last changed line
-- 		    added	0
-- 		    col		first column with a change or 1
--
-- 		The entries are in the order the changes were made, thus the
-- 		most recent change is at the end.  The line numbers are valid
-- 		when the callback is invoked, but later changes may make them
-- 		invalid, thus keeping a copy for later might not work.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked just before the screen is updated,
-- 		when |listener_flush()| is called or when a change is being
-- 		made that changes the line count in a way it causes a line
-- 		number in the list of changes to become invalid.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with the text locked, see
-- 		|textlock|.  If you do need to make changes to the buffer, use
-- 		a timer to do this later |timer_start()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is not invoked when the buffer is first loaded.
-- 		Use the |BufReadPost| autocmd event to handle the initial text
-- 		of a buffer.
-- 		The {callback} is also not invoked when the buffer is
-- 		unloaded, use the |BufUnload| autocmd event for that.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|, the base is passed as the
-- 		second argument: >
-- 			GetBuffer()->listener_add(callback)
--- @return number
function vim.fn.listener_add(callback, buf) end

-- Invoke listener callbacks for buffer {buf}.  If there are no
-- 		pending changes then no callbacks are invoked.
--
-- 		{buf} refers to a buffer name or number. For the accepted
-- 		values, see |bufname()|.  When {buf} is omitted the current
-- 		buffer is used.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetBuffer()->listener_flush()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.listener_flush(buf) end

-- Escape the characters in {chars} that occur in {string} with a
-- 		backslash.  Example: >

-- <		results in: >
-- 			c:\\program\ files\\vim
-- <		Also see |shellescape()| and |fnameescape()|.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.escape(string, chars) end

-- Return a Float that represents the time value of {time}.
-- 		Unit of time is seconds.
-- 		Example:
-- 			let start = reltime()
-- 			call MyFunction()
-- 			let seconds = reltimefloat(reltime(start))
-- 		See the note of reltimestr() about overhead.
--  		Also see |profiling|.
--- @return float

-- The result is a String, which is {expr} with all unprintable
-- 		characters translated into printable characters |'isprint'|.

-- 		starting a new line.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.strtrans(expr) end

-- Check if there is a mapping that matches with {name} in mode
-- 		{mode}.  See |maparg()| for {mode} and special names in
-- 		{name}.
-- 		When {abbr} is there and it is non-zero use abbreviations
-- 		instead of mappings.
-- 		A match happens with a mapping that starts with {name} and
-- 		with a mapping which is equal to the start of {name}.
--
-- 			matches mapping "a"	"ab"	"abc" ~
-- 		   mapcheck("a")	yes	yes	 yes
-- 		   mapcheck("abc")	yes	yes	 yes
-- 		   mapcheck("ax")	yes	no	 no
-- 		   mapcheck("b")	no	no	 no
--
-- 		The difference with maparg() is that mapcheck() finds a
-- 		mapping that matches with {name}, while maparg() only finds a
-- 		mapping for {name} exactly.
-- 		When there is no mapping that starts with {name}, an empty
-- 		String is returned.  If there is one, the RHS of that mapping
-- 		is returned.  If there are several mappings that start with
-- 		{name}, the RHS of one of them is returned.  This will be
-- 		"<Nop>" if the RHS is empty.
-- 		The mappings local to the current buffer are checked first,
-- 		then the global mappings.
-- 		This function can be used to check if a mapping can be added
-- 		without being ambiguous.  Example: >
-- 	:if mapcheck("_vv") == ""
-- 	:   map _vv :set guifont=7x13<CR>
-- 	:endif
-- <		This avoids adding the "_vv" mapping when there already is a
-- 		mapping for "_v" or for "_vvv".
--- @return string
function vim.fn.mapcheck(name, mode, abbr) end

-- Send the {string} to {server}.  The string is sent as an
-- 		expression and the result is returned after evaluation.
-- 		The result must be a String or a |List|.  A |List| is turned
-- 		into a String by joining the items with a line break in
-- 		between (not at the end), like with join(expr, "\n").
-- 		If {idvar} is present and not empty, it is taken as the name
-- 		of a variable and a {serverid} for later use with
-- 		|remote_read()| is stored there.
-- 		If {timeout} is given the read times out after this many
-- 		seconds.  Otherwise a timeout of 600 seconds is used.
-- 		See also |clientserver| |RemoteReply|.
-- 		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
-- 		Note: Any errors will cause a local error message to be issued
-- 		and the result will be the empty string.
--
-- 		Variables will be evaluated in the global namespace,
-- 		independent of a function currently being active.  Except
-- 		when in debug mode, then local function variables and
-- 		arguments can be evaluated.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:echo remote_expr("gvim", "2+2")
-- 			:echo remote_expr("gvim1", "b:current_syntax")
-- <
--- @return string
function vim.fn.remote_expr(server, string, idvar, timeout) end

-- Evaluate Perl expression {expr} in scalar context and return
-- 		its result converted to Vim data structures. If value can't be
-- 		converted, it is returned as a string Perl representation.
-- 		Note: If you want an array or hash, {expr} must return a
-- 		reference to it.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo perleval('[1 .. 4]')
-- <			[1, 2, 3, 4]
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >

-- 		to bring itself to the foreground.
-- 		Note: This does not restore the window if it was minimized,

-- 		Returns -1 if something is wrong.
-- 		See also |clientserver|.
-- 		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
-- 		Examples: >

-- 		"bufnum" is zero, unless a mark like '0 or 'A is used, then it
-- 		is the buffer number of the mark.
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.
-- 		The "off" number is zero, unless 'virtualedit' is used.  Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
-- 		Note that for '< and '> Visual mode matters: when it is "V"
-- 		(visual line mode) the column of '< is zero and the column of
-- 		'> is a large number.
-- 		This can be used to save and restore the position of a mark: >
-- 			let save_a_mark = getpos("'a")

-- 		Moves the cursor to the found match.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			if searchdecl('myvar') == 0
-- 			   echo getline('.')
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 							*searchpair()*
-- searchpair({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
-- 				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
-- 		Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
-- 		used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
-- 		if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
-- 		The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
-- 		forward, include 'b' in {flags} to search backward.
-- 		If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
-- 		line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
-- 		returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
-- 		given.
--
-- 		{start}, {middle} and {end} are patterns, see |pattern|.  They
-- 		must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
-- 		{middle} is not empty, it is found when searching from either
-- 		direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
-- 		typical use is: >
-- 			searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
-- <		By leaving {middle} empty the "else" is skipped.
--
-- 		{flags} 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
-- 		|search()|.  Additionally:
-- 		'r'	Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
-- 			outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
-- 		'm'	Return number of matches instead of line number with
-- 			the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
-- 		Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
-- 		avoid wrapping around the end of the file.
--
-- 		When a match for {start}, {middle} or {end} is found, the
-- 		{skip} expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
-- 		the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
-- 		match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
-- 		or a string.
-- 		When {skip} is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
-- 		When evaluating {skip} causes an error the search is aborted
-- 		and -1 returned.
--  		{skip} can be a string, a lambda, a funcref or a partial.
-- 		Anything else makes the function fail.
--
-- 		For {stopline} and {timeout} see |search()|.
--
-- 		The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
-- 		patterns are used like it's on.
--
-- 		The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
-- 		{start}, {middle} or {end} at the next character, in the
-- 		direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example: >
-- 			if 1
-- 			  if 2
-- 			  endif 2
-- 			endif 1
-- <		When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
-- 		searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
-- 		the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
-- 		found.  That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
-- 		then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
-- 		"endif 2".
-- 		When searching backwards and {end} is more than one character,
-- 		it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
-- 		that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
-- 		the matching start.
--
-- 		Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
-- 			\ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')
--
-- <		The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
-- 		to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
-- 		having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
-- 		catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
-- 		Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway through a line is considered
-- 		a match.
-- 		Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}": >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')
--
-- <		This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
-- 		match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
-- 		highlighting recognized as strings: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
-- 	     \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
-- <
-- 							*searchpairpos()*
-- searchpairpos({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
-- 				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
-- 		Same as |searchpair()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
-- 		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
-- 		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
-- 		the column position of the match.  If no match is found,
-- 		returns [0, 0]. >
--
-- 			:let [lnum,col] = searchpairpos('{', '', '}', 'n')
-- <
-- 		See |match-parens| for a bigger and more useful example.

-- 		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
-- 		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
-- 		the current item.
-- 		For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key of the current item.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
-- <		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
-- 			call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
-- <		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
-- 			call filter(var, 0)
-- <		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
-- 			1. the key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return |TRUE| if the item should be kept.
-- 		Example that keeps the odd items of a list: >
-- 			func Odd(idx, val)
-- 			  return a:idx % 2 == 1
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call filter(mylist, function('Odd'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx, val -> idx * val <= 42})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx -> idx % 2 == 1})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
-- 		further items in {expr1} are processed. When {expr2} is a
-- 		Funcref errors inside a function are ignored, unless it was
-- 		defined with the "abort" flag.

-- 		Limitations:
-- 		1. Mapping ordering is not preserved unless messagepack

-- 		   (|msgpack-special-map|).
-- 		2. Since the parser aims to preserve all data untouched
-- 		   (except for 1.) some strings are parsed to
-- 		   |msgpack-special-dict| format which is not convenient to
-- 		   use.
-- 							*msgpack-special-dict*
-- 		Some messagepack strings may be parsed to special
-- 		dictionaries. Special dictionaries are dictionaries which
--
-- 		1. Contain exactly two keys: `_TYPE` and `_VAL`.
-- 		2. `_TYPE` key is one of the types found in |v:msgpack_types|
-- 		   variable.

-- 		   contains name of the key from |v:msgpack_types|):
--
-- 		Key	Value ~
-- 		nil	Zero, ignored when dumping.  Not returned by
-- 			|msgpackparse()| since |v:null| was introduced.
-- 		boolean	One or zero.  When dumping it is only checked that
-- 			value is a |Number|.  Not returned by |msgpackparse()|
-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use
-- 			code like >
-- 				_VAL[0] * ((_VAL[1] << 62)
-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output under one of the following
-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
-- 			reasons.
-- 		binary	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if binary string
-- 			contains zero byte.
-- 		array	|List|. This value cannot appear in |msgpackparse()|

-- Stop the {job}.  This can also be used to signal the job.

-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT

-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly

--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be
-- 		sent.  This is to avoid to stop the wrong job (esp. on Unix,
-- 		where process numbers are recycled).
--
-- 		When using "kill" Vim will assume the job will die and close
-- 		the channel.

-- Escape {string} for use as file name command argument.  All

-- 		A leading '+' and '>' is also escaped (special after |:edit|
-- 		and |:write|).  And a "-" by itself (special after |:cd|).
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let fname = '+some str%nge|name'

-- 			  return a:key . '-' . a:val
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call map(myDict, function('KeyValue'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >

-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' . key})
-- <		If you do not use "key" you can use a short name: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {_, val -> 'item: ' . val})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or

--
-- 		The {expr} argument is a string, which contains one of these:
-- 			&option-name	Vim option (only checks if it exists,
-- 					not if it really works)
-- 			+option-name	Vim option that works.
-- 			$ENVNAME	environment variable (could also be
-- 					done by comparing with an empty
-- 					string)
-- 			*funcname	built-in function (see |functions|)
-- 					or user defined function (see
-- 					|user-function|). Also works for a
-- 					variable that is a Funcref.
-- 			varname		internal variable (see
-- 					|internal-variables|).  Also works
-- 					for |curly-braces-names|, |Dictionary|
-- 					entries, |List| items, etc.  Beware
-- 					that evaluating an index may cause an
-- 					error message for an invalid
-- 					expression.  E.g.: >

-- <					   0 >
-- 					   :echo exists("l[xx]")
-- <					   E121: Undefined variable: xx
-- 					   0
-- 			:cmdname	Ex command: built-in command, user
-- 					command or command modifier |:command|.
-- 					Returns:
-- 					1  for match with start of a command
-- 					2  full match with a command
-- 					3  matches several user commands
-- 					To check for a supported command
-- 					always check the return value to be 2.
-- 			:2match		The |:2match| command.
-- 			:3match		The |:3match| command.
-- 			#event		autocommand defined for this event
-- 			#event#pattern	autocommand defined for this event and
-- 					pattern (the pattern is taken
-- 					literally and compared to the
-- 					autocommand patterns character by
-- 					character)
-- 			#group		autocommand group exists
-- 			#group#event	autocommand defined for this group and
-- 					event.
-- 			#group#event#pattern
-- 					autocommand defined for this group,
-- 					event and pattern.
-- 			##event		autocommand for this event is

--
-- 		{callback} is the function to call.  It can be the name of a

-- 		waiting for input.
--
-- 		{options} is a dictionary.  Supported entries:

-- 		{name} is always expanded to the full path, since that is what
-- 		is used internally.
-- 		If {name} is empty undofile() returns an empty string, since a

-- <		The number of leading dashes depends on the foldlevel.  The
-- 		"45" is the number of lines in the fold.  "abcdef" is the text
-- 		in the first non-blank line of the fold.  Leading white space,

-- 		- The badly spelled word or an empty string.
-- 		- The type of the spelling error:
-- 			"bad"		spelling mistake
-- 			"rare"		rare word
-- 			"local"		word only valid in another region
-- 			"caps"		word should start with Capital
-- 		Example: >
-- 			echo spellbadword("the quik brown fox")

-- Return a string which contains characters indicating the
-- 		current state.  Mostly useful in callbacks that want to do
-- 		work that may not always be safe.  Roughly this works like:
-- 		- callback uses state() to check if work is safe to do.
-- 		  Yes: then do it right away.
-- 		  No:  add to work queue and add a |SafeState| and/or
-- 		       |SafeStateAgain| autocommand (|SafeState| triggers at
-- 		       toplevel, |SafeStateAgain| triggers after handling
-- 		       messages and callbacks).
-- 		- When SafeState or SafeStateAgain is triggered and executes
-- 		  your autocommand, check with `state()` if the work can be
-- 		  done now, and if yes remove it from the queue and execute.
-- 		  Remove the autocommand if the queue is now empty.
-- 		Also see |mode()|.
--
-- 		When {what} is given only characters in this string will be
-- 		added.  E.g, this checks if the screen has scrolled: >
-- 			if state('s') == ''
-- 			   " screen has not scrolled
-- <
-- 		These characters indicate the state, generally indicating that
-- 		something is busy:
-- 		    m	halfway a mapping, :normal command, feedkeys() or
-- 			stuffed command
-- 		    o	operator pending or waiting for a command argument,
-- 		        e.g. after |f|
-- 		    a	Insert mode autocomplete active
-- 		    x	executing an autocommand
-- 		    w	blocked on waiting, e.g. ch_evalexpr(), ch_read() and
-- 			ch_readraw() when reading json.
-- 		    S	not triggering SafeState or SafeStateAgain

--- @return string

-- Return a |List| with the lines starting from {lnum} to {end}
-- 		(inclusive) in the buffer {expr}.  If {end} is omitted, a

--
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
--
-- 		For {lnum} and {end} "$" can be used for the last line of the
-- 		buffer.  Otherwise a number must be used.
--
-- 		When {lnum} is smaller than 1 or bigger than the number of
-- 		lines in the buffer, an empty |List| is returned.
--
-- 		When {end} is greater than the number of lines in the buffer,
-- 		it is treated as {end} is set to the number of lines in the
-- 		buffer.  When {end} is before {lnum} an empty |List| is
-- 		returned.
--

--
-- 		If {list} is given and it is |TRUE|, a List will be returned.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty string.  A name
-- 		for a non-existing file is not included, unless {expr} does
-- 		not start with '%', '#' or '<', see below.
--
-- 		When {expr} starts with '%', '#' or '<', the expansion is done
-- 		like for the |cmdline-special| variables with their associated
-- 		modifiers.  Here is a short overview:
--
-- 			%		current file name
-- 			#		alternate file name
-- 			#n		alternate file name n
-- 			<cfile>		file name under the cursor
-- 			<afile>		autocmd file name
-- 			<abuf>		autocmd buffer number (as a String!)
-- 			<amatch>	autocmd matched name
-- 			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in
-- 					a function
-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor
-- 			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
-- 			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received
-- 					message |server2client()|
-- 		Modifiers:
-- 			:p		expand to full path
-- 			:h		head (last path component removed)
-- 			:t		tail (last path component only)
-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &tags = expand("%:p:h") . "/tags"
-- <		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
-- 		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >
-- 			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
-- <		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
-- 		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
-- 		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
-- 		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >
-- 			:echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
-- <
-- 		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
-- 		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
-- 		to modify normal file names.
--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
-- 		{nosuf} argument is given and it is |TRUE|.
-- 		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
-- 		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
-- 		all "README" files in the current directory and below: >
-- 			:echo expand("**/README")
-- <
-- 		expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
-- 		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
-- 		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
-- 		|expr-env-expand|.
-- 		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
-- 		names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
-- 		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
-- 		"$FOOBAR".
--
-- 		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for
-- 		getting the raw output of an external command.
--- @param list any[]

-- Stop playing sound {id}.  {id} must be previously returned by
-- 		`sound_playevent()` or `sound_playfile()`.

-- 		  a.k.a. epoch time otherwise; this only has second accuracy.
-- 		- If {expr} is given it must be a Number.  It is used to
-- 		  initialize the seed values.  This is useful for testing or
-- 		  when a predictable sequence is intended.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:let seed = srand()
-- 			:let seed = srand(userinput)
-- 			:echo rand(seed)
--- @return list
function vim.fn.srand(expr) end

-- The result is a Number, which is a unix timestamp representing
-- 		the date and time in {timestring}, which is expected to match
-- 		the format specified in {format}.
--
-- 		The accepted {format} depends on your system, thus this is not
-- 		portable!  See the manual page of the C function strptime()
-- 		for the format.  Especially avoid "%c".  The value of $TZ also
-- 		matters.
--
-- 		If the {timestring} cannot be parsed with {format} zero is
-- 		returned.  If you do not know the format of {timestring} you
-- 		can try different {format} values until you get a non-zero
-- 		result.

-- Open a new window displaying the difference between the two
-- 		files.  The files must have been created with
-- 		|term_dumpwrite()|.
-- 		Returns the buffer number or zero when the diff fails.
-- 		Also see |terminal-diff|.
-- 		NOTE: this does not work with double-width characters yet.
--
-- 		The top part of the buffer contains the contents of the first
-- 		file, the bottom part of the buffer contains the contents of
-- 		the second file.  The middle part shows the differences.
-- 		The parts are separated by a line of equals.
--
-- 		If the {options} argument is present, it must be a Dict with
-- 		these possible members:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead
-- 				     of the first file name.
-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "term_cols"	     horizontal size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically
-- 		   "curwin"	     use the current window, do not split the
-- 				     window; fails if the current buffer
-- 				     cannot be |abandon|ed
-- 		   "bufnr"	     do not create a new buffer, use the

-- 				     visible in a window.
-- 		   "norestore"	     do not add the terminal window to a
-- 				     session file
--
-- 		Each character in the middle part indicates a difference. If

-- 		used:
-- 			X	different character
-- 			w	different width
-- 			f	different foreground color
-- 			b	different background color
-- 			a	different attribute
-- 			+	missing position in first file
-- 			-	missing position in second file

-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.

-- 		item as {end} a list with one item is returned.  When {end}
-- 		points to an item before {idx} this is an error.

--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is '1' or 'i' then case is
-- 		ignored.
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'n' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical (Implementation detail: This uses the
-- 		strtod() function to parse numbers, Strings, Lists, Dicts and
-- 		Funcrefs will be considered as being 0).
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'N' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical. This is like 'n' but a string containing
-- 		digits will be used as the number they represent.
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'f' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical. All values must be a Number or a Float.
--
-- 		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function
-- 		is called to compare items.  The function is invoked with two
-- 		items as argument and must return zero if they are equal, 1 or
-- 		bigger if the first one sorts after the second one, -1 or
-- 		smaller if the first one sorts before the second one.
--
-- 		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
-- 		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|
--
-- 		The sort is stable, items which compare equal (as number or as
-- 		string) will keep their relative position. E.g., when sorting
-- 		on numbers, text strings will sort next to each other, in the
-- 		same order as they were originally.
--
-- 		Also see |uniq()|.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			func MyCompare(i1, i2)
-- 			   return a:i1 == a:i2 ? 0 : a:i1 > a:i2 ? 1 : -1
-- 			endfunc
-- 			let sortedlist = sort(mylist, "MyCompare")

-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index

-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

--
-- 		{data} may be a string, string convertible, or a list.  If
