-- Return a list of signs placed in a buffer or all the buffers.
-- 		This is similar to the |:sign-place-list| command.
--
-- 		If the optional buffer name {expr} is specified, then only the

-- 		If {group} is '*', then signs in all the groups including the
-- 		global group are returned. If {group} is not supplied or is an
-- 		empty string, then only signs in the global group are
-- 		returned.  If no arguments are supplied, then signs in the
-- 		global group placed in all the buffers are returned.
-- 		See |sign-group|.
--
-- 		Each list item in the returned value is a dictionary with the
-- 		following entries:
-- 			bufnr	number of the buffer with the sign
-- 			signs	list of signs placed in {bufnr}. Each list
-- 				item is a dictionary with the below listed
-- 				entries
--
-- 		The dictionary for each sign contains the following entries:
-- 			group	sign group. Set to '' for the global group.
-- 			id	identifier of the sign
-- 			lnum	line number where the sign is placed
-- 			name	name of the defined sign
-- 			priority	sign priority
--
-- 		The returned signs in a buffer are ordered by their line
-- 		number and priority.

--
-- 		Limitations:
-- 		1. Mapping ordering is not preserved unless messagepack

-- 		   (|msgpack-special-map|).
-- 		2. Since the parser aims to preserve all data untouched

-- 		   use.
-- 							*msgpack-special-dict*
-- 		Some messagepack strings may be parsed to special
-- 		dictionaries. Special dictionaries are dictionaries which
--
-- 		1. Contain exactly two keys: `_TYPE` and `_VAL`.
-- 		2. `_TYPE` key is one of the types found in |v:msgpack_types|
-- 		   variable.
-- 		3. Value for `_VAL` has the following format (Key column
-- 		   contains name of the key from |v:msgpack_types|):
--
-- 		Key	Value ~
-- 		nil	Zero, ignored when dumping.  Not returned by
-- 			|msgpackparse()| since |v:null| was introduced.
-- 		boolean	One or zero.  When dumping it is only checked that
-- 			value is a |Number|.  Not returned by |msgpackparse()|
-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use
-- 			code like >
-- 				_VAL[0] * ((_VAL[1] << 62)
-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output under one of the following
-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
-- 			reasons.
-- 		binary	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if binary string
-- 			contains zero byte.
-- 		array	|List|. This value cannot appear in |msgpackparse()|
-- 			output.
-- 							*msgpack-special-map*
-- 		map	|List| of |List|s with two items (key and value) each.
-- 			This value will appear in |msgpackparse()| output if
-- 			parsed mapping contains one of the following keys:

-- 			   are binary strings).
-- 			2. String with NUL byte inside.
-- 			3. Duplicate key.
-- 			4. Empty key.

-- Shorten directory names in the path {expr} and return the

-- Attach a text property at position {lnum}, {col}.  {col} is

--
-- 		{props} is a dictionary with these fields:
-- 		   length	length of text in bytes, can only be used
-- 				for a property that does not continue in
-- 				another line; can be zero
-- 		   end_lnum	line number for the end of text
-- 		   end_col	column just after the text; not used when
-- 				"length" is present; when {col} and "end_col"
-- 				are equal, and "end_lnum" is omitted or equal
-- 				to {lnum}, this is a zero-width text property
-- 		   bufnr	buffer to add the property to; when omitted
-- 				the current buffer is used
-- 		   id		user defined ID for the property; when omitted
-- 				zero is used
-- 		   type		name of the text property type
-- 		All fields except "type" are optional.
--
-- 		It is an error when both "length" and "end_lnum" or "end_col"
-- 		are given.  Either use "length" or "end_col" for a property
-- 		within one line, or use "end_lnum" and "end_col" for a
-- 		property that spans more than one line.
-- 		When neither "length" nor "end_col" are given the property
-- 		will be zero-width.  That means it will not be highlighted but
-- 		will move with the text, as a kind of mark.
-- 		The property can end exactly at the last character of the
-- 		text, or just after it.  In the last case, if text is appended
-- 		to the line, the text property size will increase, also when
-- 		the property type does not have "end_incl" set.
--
-- 		"type" will first be looked up in the buffer the property is
-- 		added to. When not found, the global property types are used.
-- 		If not found an error is given.

-- Return the natural logarithm (base e) of {expr} as a |Float|.

-- On MS-Windows, when {filename} is a shortcut (a .lnk file),
-- 		returns the path the shortcut points to in a simplified form.
-- 		On Unix, repeat resolving symbolic links in all path
-- 		components of {filename} and return the simplified result.
-- 		To cope with link cycles, resolving of symbolic links is
-- 		stopped after 100 iterations.
-- 		On other systems, return the simplified {filename}.
-- 		The simplification step is done as by |simplify()|.
-- 		resolve() keeps a leading path component specifying the

-- 		Examples: >

-- The result is a Number, which is the height of window {nr}.
-- 		{nr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the height of the current window is

-- Adds a watcher to a dictionary. A dictionary watcher is
-- 		identified by three components:
--
-- 		- A dictionary({dict});
-- 		- A key pattern({pattern}).
-- 		- A function({callback}).
--
-- 		After this is called, every change on {dict} and on keys
-- 		matching {pattern} will result in {callback} being invoked.
--
-- 		For example, to watch all global variables: >
-- 			silent! call dictwatcherdel(g:, '*', 'OnDictChanged')
-- 			function! OnDictChanged(d,k,z)
-- 			  echomsg string(a:k) string(a:z)
-- 			endfunction
-- 			call dictwatcheradd(g:, '*', 'OnDictChanged')
-- <
-- 		For now {pattern} only accepts very simple patterns that can
-- 		contain a '*' at the end of the string, in which case it will
-- 		match every key that begins with the substring before the '*'.
-- 		That means if '*' is not the last character of {pattern}, only
-- 		keys that are exactly equal as {pattern} will be matched.
--
-- 		The {callback} receives three arguments:
--
-- 		- The dictionary being watched.
-- 		- The key which changed.
-- 		- A dictionary containing the new and old values for the key.
--
-- 		The type of change can be determined by examining the keys
-- 		present on the third argument:
--
-- 		- If contains both `old` and `new`, the key was updated.
-- 		- If it contains only `new`, the key was added.
-- 		- If it contains only `old`, the key was deleted.
--
-- 		This function can be used by plugins to implement options with
-- 		validation and parsing logic.

--- @return number
function vim.fn.screenrow() end

-- Return the current command-line.  Only works when the command
-- 		line is being edited, thus requires use of |c_CTRL-\_e| or

-- 		Example: >
-- 			:cmap <F7> <C-\>eescape(getcmdline(), ' \')<CR>
-- <		Also see |getcmdtype()|, |getcmdpos()| and |setcmdpos()|.
-- 		Returns an empty string when entering a password or using
-- 		|inputsecret()|.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.getcmdline() end

-- Move the window {nr} to a new split of the window {target}.
-- 		This is similar to moving to {target}, creating a new window
-- 		using |:split| but having the same contents as window {nr}, and
-- 		then closing {nr}.
--
-- 		Both {nr} and {target} can be window numbers or |window-ID|s.
--
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
--
-- 		{options} is a Dictionary with the following optional entries:
-- 		  "vertical"	When TRUE, the split is created vertically,
-- 				like with |:vsplit|.
-- 		  "rightbelow"	When TRUE, the split is made below or to the
-- 				right (if vertical).  When FALSE, it is done
-- 				above or to the left (if vertical).  When not
-- 				present, the values of 'splitbelow' and
-- 				'splitright' are used.

-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetWinid()->win_splitmove(target)
-- <
--- @return number
function vim.fn.win_splitmove(nr, target, options) end

-- The result is the Number of the current entry in {history}.

-- 		64-bit Number support is enabled, 0x7fffffffffffffff or
-- 		-0x7fffffffffffffff).  NaN results in -0x80000000 (or when

-- The result is a Dict with the screen position of the text

-- 			curscol	cursor screen column
-- 		If the specified position is not visible, all values are zero.
-- 		The "endcol" value differs from "col" when the character
-- 		occupies more than one screen cell.  E.g. for a Tab "col" can
-- 		be 1 and "endcol" can be 8.
-- 		The "curscol" value is where the cursor would be placed.  For

--
-- 		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function

--
-- 		    bufnr	buffer number; must be the number of a valid
-- 				buffer
-- 		    filename	name of a file; only used when "bufnr" is not
-- 				present or it is invalid.
-- 		    module	name of a module; if given it will be used in
-- 				quickfix error window instead of the filename
-- 		    lnum	line number in the file
-- 		    pattern	search pattern used to locate the error
-- 		    col		column number
-- 		    vcol	when non-zero: "col" is visual column
-- 				when zero: "col" is byte index
-- 		    nr		error number
-- 		    text	description of the error
-- 		    type	single-character error type, 'E', 'W', etc.
-- 		    valid	recognized error message
--
-- 		The "col", "vcol", "nr", "type" and "text" entries are
-- 		optional.  Either "lnum" or "pattern" entry can be used to
-- 		locate a matching error line.
-- 		If the "filename" and "bufnr" entries are not present or
-- 		neither the "lnum" or "pattern" entries are present, then the
-- 		item will not be handled as an error line.
-- 		If both "pattern" and "lnum" are present then "pattern" will
-- 		be used.
-- 		If the "valid" entry is not supplied, then the valid flag is
-- 		set when "bufnr" is a valid buffer or "filename" exists.
-- 		If you supply an empty {list}, the quickfix list will be
-- 		cleared.
-- 		Note that the list is not exactly the same as what
-- 		|getqflist()| returns.
--
-- 		{action} values:				*E927*
-- 		'a'	The items from {list} are added to the existing
-- 			quickfix list. If there is no existing list, then a
-- 			new list is created.
--
-- 		'r'	The items from the current quickfix list are replaced
-- 			with the items from {list}.  This can also be used to
-- 			clear the list: >
-- 				:call setqflist([], 'r')
-- <
-- 		'f'	All the quickfix lists in the quickfix stack are
-- 			freed.
--
-- 		If {action} is not present or is set to ' ', then a new list
-- 		is created. The new quickfix list is added after the current
-- 		quickfix list in the stack and all the following lists are
-- 		freed. To add a new quickfix list at the end of the stack,
-- 		set "nr" in {what} to "$".
--
-- 		If the optional {what} dictionary argument is supplied, then
-- 		only the items listed in {what} are set. The first {list}
-- 		argument is ignored.  The following items can be specified in
-- 		{what}:
-- 		    context	quickfix list context. See |quickfix-context|
-- 		    efm		errorformat to use when parsing text from
-- 				"lines". If this is not present, then the
-- 				'errorformat' option value is used.
-- 		    id		quickfix list identifier |quickfix-ID|
-- 		    items	list of quickfix entries. Same as the {list}
-- 				argument.
-- 		    lines	use 'errorformat' to parse a list of lines and
-- 				add the resulting entries to the quickfix list
-- 				{nr} or {id}.  Only a |List| value is supported.
-- 		    nr		list number in the quickfix stack; zero
-- 				means the current quickfix list and "$" means
-- 				the last quickfix list
-- 		    title	quickfix list title text
-- 		Unsupported keys in {what} are ignored.
-- 		If the "nr" item is not present, then the current quickfix list
-- 		is modified. When creating a new quickfix list, "nr" can be
-- 		set to a value one greater than the quickfix stack size.
-- 		When modifying a quickfix list, to guarantee that the correct
-- 		list is modified, "id" should be used instead of "nr" to
-- 		specify the list.
--
-- 		Examples (See also |setqflist-examples|): >
-- 		   :call setqflist([], 'r', {'title': 'My search'})
-- 		   :call setqflist([], 'r', {'nr': 2, 'title': 'Errors'})

-- <
-- 		Returns zero for success, -1 for failure.

-- 		When {flags} contains "b" then binary mode is used: There will
-- 		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
-- 		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.
--
-- 		When {flags} contains "a" then append mode is used, lines are
-- 		appended to the file: >
-- 			:call writefile(["foo"], "event.log", "a")
-- 			:call writefile(["bar"], "event.log", "a")
-- <
-- 		When {flags} contains "S" fsync() call is not used, with "s"
-- 		it is used, 'fsync' option applies by default. No fsync()
-- 		means that writefile() will finish faster, but writes may be
-- 		left in OS buffers and not yet written to disk. Such changes
-- 		will disappear if system crashes before OS does writing.
--
-- 		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
-- 		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
-- 		to writefile().
-- 		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
-- 		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
-- 		error message if the file can't be created or when writing
-- 		fails.

--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay

-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character

--
-- 		With one argument it returns the time passed since the time

-- 		With two arguments it returns the time passed between {start}

-- Start a job and return a Job object.  Unlike |system()| and
-- 		|:!cmd| this does not wait for the job to finish.
-- 		To start a job in a terminal window see |term_start()|.
--
-- 		If the job fails to start then |job_status()| on the returned
-- 		Job object results in "fail" and none of the callbacks will be
-- 		invoked.
--
-- 		{command} can be a String.  This works best on MS-Windows.  On
-- 		Unix it is split up in white-separated parts to be passed to
-- 		execvp().  Arguments in double quotes can contain white space.
--
-- 		{command} can be a List, where the first item is the executable
-- 		and further items are the arguments.  All items are converted
-- 		to String.  This works best on Unix.
--
-- 		On MS-Windows, job_start() makes a GUI application hidden. If
-- 		want to show it, Use |:!start| instead.
--
-- 		The command is executed directly, not through a shell, the
-- 		'shell' option is not used.  To use the shell: >
-- 	let job = job_start(["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo hello"])
-- <		Or: >
-- 	let job = job_start('/bin/sh -c "echo hello"')
-- <		Note that this will start two processes, the shell and the
-- 		command it executes.  If you don't want this use the "exec"
-- 		shell command.
--
-- 		On Unix $PATH is used to search for the executable only when
-- 		the command does not contain a slash.
--
-- 		The job will use the same terminal as Vim.  If it reads from
-- 		stdin the job and Vim will be fighting over input, that
-- 		doesn't work.  Redirect stdin and stdout to avoid problems: >
-- 	let job = job_start(['sh', '-c', "myserver </dev/null >/dev/null"])
-- <
-- 		The returned Job object can be used to get the status with
-- 		|job_status()| and stop the job with |job_stop()|.
--
-- 		Note that the job object will be deleted if there are no
-- 		references to it.  This closes the stdin and stderr, which may
-- 		cause the job to fail with an error.  To avoid this keep a
-- 		reference to the job.  Thus instead of: >
-- 	call job_start('my-command')
-- <		use: >
-- 	let myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <		and unlet "myjob" once the job is not needed or is past the
-- 		point where it would fail (e.g. when it prints a message on
-- 		startup).  Keep in mind that variables local to a function
-- 		will cease to exist if the function returns.  Use a
-- 		script-local variable if needed: >
-- 	let s:myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <
-- 		{options} must be a Dictionary.  It can contain many optional

-- Send {string} over {handle}.

--
-- 		Works like |ch_evalexpr()|, but does not encode the request or

-- 		is removed.
-- 		Note that Vim does not know when the text received on a raw

-- 		Composing characters are not counted separately, their byte
-- 		length is added to the preceding base character.  See
-- 		|byteidxcomp()| below for counting composing characters

-- 		Example : >

-- <		Also see |strgetchar()| and |strcharpart()|.

-- Call function {funcname} in the run-time library {libname}
-- 		with single argument {argument}.
-- 		This is useful to call functions in a library that you
-- 		especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
-- 		is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
-- 		limited.
-- 		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
-- 		function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
-- 		to Vim.
-- 		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
-- 		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
-- 		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a
-- 		null-terminated string.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
-- 		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
-- 		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the

-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.

-- 		replace all "'" with "'\''".
--
-- 		When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero
-- 		Number or a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then special
-- 		items such as "!", "%", "#" and "<cword>" will be preceded by
-- 		a backslash.  This backslash will be removed again by the |:!|
-- 		command.
--
-- 		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|
-- 		{special}) when 'shell' contains "csh" in the tail.  That is
-- 		because for csh and tcsh "!" is used for history replacement
-- 		even when inside single quotes.
--
-- 		With a |non-zero-arg| {special} the <NL> character is also
-- 		escaped.  When 'shell' containing "csh" in the tail it's
-- 		escaped a second time.
--
-- 		Example of use with a |:!| command: >
-- 		    :exe '!dir ' . shellescape(expand('<cfile>'), 1)
-- <		This results in a directory listing for the file under the

-- <		On MS-Windows, {name} can be SystemAsterisk, SystemDefault,

-- 		SystemStart, SystemWelcome, etc.
--
-- 		When {callback} is specified it is invoked when the sound is

-- 		argument is the status:
-- 			0	sound was played to the end
-- 			1	sound was interrupted

-- 		Example: >

-- 		    tabpagewinnr(4, '$')    " number of windows in tab page 4
-- <		When {tabarg} is invalid zero is returned.

-- {expr1} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
-- 		Replace each item in {expr1} with the result of evaluating
-- 		{expr2}. {expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
-- 		of the current item. For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
-- 		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
-- 		the current item.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:call map(mylist, '"> " . v:val . " <"')
-- <		This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of an expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.  You
-- 		still have to double ' quotes
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it is called with two arguments:
-- 			1. The key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return the new value of the item. Example
-- 		that changes each value by "key-value": >
-- 			func KeyValue(key, val)
-- 			  return a:key . '-' . a:val
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call map(myDict, function('KeyValue'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key, val -> key . '-' . val})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' . key})
-- <		If you do not use "key" you can use a short name: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {_, val -> 'item: ' . val})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let tlist = map(copy(mylist), ' v:val . "\t"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no

-- {textlist} must be a |List| of strings.  This |List| is

-- 		clicking on the prompt one more than the length of {textlist}
-- 		is returned.
-- 		Make sure {textlist} has less than 'lines' entries, otherwise
-- 		it won't work.  It's a good idea to put the entry number at
-- 		the start of the string.  And put a prompt in the first item.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			let color = inputlist(['Select color:', '1. red',
-- 				\ '2. green', '3. blue'])
--- @return number

--
-- 		Prefix {name} with a unique text to avoid name collisions.
-- 		There is no {group} like with placing signs.
--
-- 		The {name} can be a String or a Number.  The optional {dict}
-- 		argument specifies the sign attributes.  The following values
-- 		are supported:
-- 		    icon	full path to the bitmap file for the sign.
-- 		    linehl	highlight group used for the whole line the
-- 				sign is placed in.
-- 		    text	text that is displayed when there is no icon
-- 				or the GUI is not being used.
-- 		    texthl	highlight group used for the text item
-- 		    numhl	highlight group used for 'number' column at the
-- 				associated line. Overrides |hl-LineNr|,
-- 				|hl-CursorLineNr|.
--
-- 		If the sign named {name} already exists, then the attributes
-- 		of the sign are updated.
--
-- 		Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			call sign_define("mySign", {"text" : "=>", "texthl" :

--- @param dict dictionary
--- @return number

--
-- 		There is hardly ever a need to invoke this function, as it is

-- 		for a long time.
--
-- 		When the optional {atexit} argument is one, garbage
-- 		collection will also be done when exiting Vim, if it wasn't
-- 		done before.  This is useful when checking for memory leaks.

-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off]
-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]
--
-- 		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the
-- 		current buffer.  When setting an uppercase mark "bufnum" is
-- 		used for the mark position.  For other marks it specifies the
-- 		buffer to set the mark in.  You can use the |bufnr()| function
-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,
-- 		since these are associated with a window, not a buffer.
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
-- 		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
-- 		before '>.
--
-- 		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
-- 		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.
--
-- 		Also see |getpos()| and |getcurpos()|.
--
-- 		This does not restore the preferred column for moving

--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
