-- 		is not used here, case always matters.
-- 		If {start} is given then start looking at the item with index

-- 		When {ic} is given and it is |TRUE|, ignore case.  Otherwise

--
-- 		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
-- 		If there is no match -1 is returned.
--
-- 		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
-- 		Example: >

-- 		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
-- 		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >

-- <
-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
-- 		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
-- 		The result, however, is still the index counted from the

-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

-- 		be removed from the history (if there are any).
-- 		Upper/lowercase must match, unless "\c" is used |/\c|.
-- 		If {item} evaluates to a Number, it will be interpreted as
-- 		an index, see |:history-indexing|.  The respective entry will
-- 		be removed if it exists.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 for a successful operation,
-- 		otherwise 0 is returned.
--
-- 		Examples:
-- 		Clear expression register history: >
-- 			:call histdel("expr")
-- <
-- 		Remove all entries starting with "*" from the search history: >
-- 			:call histdel("/", '^\*')
-- <
-- 		The following three are equivalent: >
-- 			:call histdel("search", histnr("search"))

-- 		:function s:check_typoname(file)
-- 		:   if fnamemodify(a:file, ':t') == '['
-- 		:       echomsg 'Maybe typo'
-- 		:       call interrupt()

-- <
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetJob()->job_getchannel()
--- @return channel
function vim.fn.job_getchannel(job) end

-- Returns a Dictionary with information about {job}:
-- 		   "status"	what |job_status()| returns
-- 		   "channel"	what |job_getchannel()| returns
-- 		   "cmd"	List of command arguments used to start the job
-- 		   "process"	process ID
-- 		   "tty_in"	terminal input name, empty when none
-- 		   "tty_out"	terminal output name, empty when none
-- 		   "exitval"	only valid when "status" is "dead"
-- 		   "exit_cb"	function to be called on exit
-- 		   "stoponexit"	|job-stoponexit|
--
-- 		   Only in Unix:
-- 		   "termsig"	the signal which terminated the process
-- 				(See |job_stop()| for the values)
-- 				only valid when "status" is "dead"
--
-- 		   Only in MS-Windows:
-- 		   "tty_type"	Type of virtual console in use.
-- 				Values are "winpty" or "conpty".
-- 				See 'termwintype'.
--
-- 		Without any arguments, returns a List with all Job objects.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetJob()->job_info()

-- Start a job and return a Job object.  Unlike |system()| and
-- 		|:!cmd| this does not wait for the job to finish.
-- 		To start a job in a terminal window see |term_start()|.
--
-- 		If the job fails to start then |job_status()| on the returned
-- 		Job object results in "fail" and none of the callbacks will be
-- 		invoked.
--
-- 		{command} can be a String.  This works best on MS-Windows.  On
-- 		Unix it is split up in white-separated parts to be passed to
-- 		execvp().  Arguments in double quotes can contain white space.
--
-- 		{command} can be a List, where the first item is the executable
-- 		and further items are the arguments.  All items are converted
-- 		to String.  This works best on Unix.
--
-- 		On MS-Windows, job_start() makes a GUI application hidden. If
-- 		want to show it, Use |:!start| instead.
--
-- 		The command is executed directly, not through a shell, the
-- 		'shell' option is not used.  To use the shell: >
-- 	let job = job_start(["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo hello"])
-- <		Or: >
-- 	let job = job_start('/bin/sh -c "echo hello"')
-- <		Note that this will start two processes, the shell and the
-- 		command it executes.  If you don't want this use the "exec"
-- 		shell command.
--
-- 		On Unix $PATH is used to search for the executable only when
-- 		the command does not contain a slash.
--
-- 		The job will use the same terminal as Vim.  If it reads from
-- 		stdin the job and Vim will be fighting over input, that
-- 		doesn't work.  Redirect stdin and stdout to avoid problems: >
-- 	let job = job_start(['sh', '-c', "myserver </dev/null >/dev/null"])
-- <
-- 		The returned Job object can be used to get the status with
-- 		|job_status()| and stop the job with |job_stop()|.
--
-- 		Note that the job object will be deleted if there are no
-- 		references to it.  This closes the stdin and stderr, which may
-- 		cause the job to fail with an error.  To avoid this keep a
-- 		reference to the job.  Thus instead of: >
-- 	call job_start('my-command')
-- <		use: >
-- 	let myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <		and unlet "myjob" once the job is not needed or is past the
-- 		point where it would fail (e.g. when it prints a message on
-- 		startup).  Keep in mind that variables local to a function
-- 		will cease to exist if the function returns.  Use a
-- 		script-local variable if needed: >
-- 	let s:myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <
-- 		{options} must be a Dictionary.  It can contain many optional
-- 		items, see |job-options|.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			BuildCommand()->job_start()
--- @return job
function vim.fn.job_start(command, options) end

-- Returns a String with the status of {job}:
-- 			"run"	job is running
-- 			"fail"	job failed to start
-- 			"dead"	job died or was stopped after running
--
-- 		On Unix a non-existing command results in "dead" instead of
-- 		"fail", because a fork happens before the failure can be
-- 		detected.
--
-- 		If an exit callback was set with the "exit_cb" option and the
-- 		job is now detected to be "dead" the callback will be invoked.
--
-- 		For more information see |job_info()|.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetJob()->job_status()
--- @return string
function vim.fn.job_status(job) end

-- Stop the {job}.  This can also be used to signal the job.
--
-- 		When {how} is omitted or is "term" the job will be terminated.
-- 		For Unix SIGTERM is sent.  On MS-Windows the job will be
-- 		terminated forcedly (there is no "gentle" way).
-- 		This goes to the process group, thus children may also be
-- 		affected.
--
-- 		Effect for Unix:
-- 			"term"	 SIGTERM (default)
-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT
-- 			"kill"	 SIGKILL (strongest way to stop)
-- 			number	 signal with that number
--
-- 		Effect for MS-Windows:
-- 			"term"	 terminate process forcedly (default)
-- 			"hup"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly
-- 			Others	 CTRL_BREAK
--
-- 		On Unix the signal is sent to the process group.  This means
-- 		that when the job is "sh -c command" it affects both the shell
-- 		and the command.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation could be executed,
-- 		0 if "how" is not supported on the system.
-- 		Note that even when the operation was executed, whether the
-- 		job was actually stopped needs to be checked with
-- 		|job_status()|.
--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be
-- 		sent.  This is to avoid to stop the wrong job (esp. on Unix,
-- 		where process numbers are recycled).
--
-- 		When using "kill" Vim will assume the job will die and close
-- 		the channel.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >

function vim.fn.job_stop(job, how) end

-- This function acts much like the |input()| function with but

-- 		|history| stack.

-- This is similar to |json_decode()| with these differences:

-- This is similar to |json_encode()| with these differences:

-- 		For example, the Vim object:
-- 			[1,v:none,{"one":1},v:none] ~
-- 		Will be encoded as:
-- 			[1,,{one:1},,] ~
-- 		While json_encode() would produce:

-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use

-- Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a

-- 		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
-- 		match using |matchdelete()|.
-- 		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
-- 		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
-- 		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
-- 		The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
-- 		concealed.
--
-- 		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
-- 		match.  A match with a high priority will have its
-- 		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
-- 		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
-- 		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
-- 		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
-- 		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
-- 		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
-- 		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
-- 		always overrule syntax highlighting.
--
-- 		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
-- 		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
-- 		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
-- 		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
-- 		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
-- 		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified or -1,
-- 		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.
--
-- 		The optional {dict} argument allows for further custom
-- 		values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
-- 		conceal character that will be shown for |hl-Conceal|
-- 		highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
--
-- 			conceal	    Special character to show instead of the
-- 				    match (only for |hl-Conceal| highlighed
-- 				    matches, see |:syn-cchar|)
-- 			window	    Instead of the current window use the
-- 				    window with this number or window ID.
--
-- 		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
-- 		the |:match| commands.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)

-- 		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
-- 			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
--
-- 		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
-- 		special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
-- 		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
-- 		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
-- 		For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
-- 		starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
-- 		the String "\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is
-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a

-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they

--
-- 		By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
-- 		buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.

--
-- 		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the

-- 		buffer to set the mark in.  You can use the |bufnr()| function
-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,
-- 		since these are associated with a window, not a buffer.
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
-- 		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
-- 		before '>.

-- 			<amatch>	autocmd matched name
-- 			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in
-- 					a function
-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor
-- 			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
-- 			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received
-- 					message |server2client()|
-- 		Modifiers:
-- 			:p		expand to full path
-- 			:h		head (last path component removed)
-- 			:t		tail (last path component only)
-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &tags = expand("%:p:h") . "/tags"
-- <		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
-- 		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >
-- 			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
-- <		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
-- 		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
-- 		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
-- 		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >

--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
-- 		{nosuf} argument is given and it is |TRUE|.
-- 		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
-- 		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
-- 		all "README" files in the current directory and below: >

-- <
-- 		expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
-- 		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
-- 		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
-- 		|expr-env-expand|.
-- 		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
-- 		names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
-- 		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
-- 		"$FOOBAR".
--
-- 		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for
-- 		getting the raw output of an external command.
--- @param list any[]

-- see |line()|.  For getting the cursor position see
-- 		|getcurpos()|.

-- 		"bufnum" is zero, unless a mark like '0 or 'A is used, then it
-- 		is the buffer number of the mark.
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first

-- 		(visual line mode) the column of '< is zero and the column of

-- 		See also |clientserver|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo server2client(expand("<client>"), "HELLO")

-- Like |strpart()| but using character index and length instead
-- 		of byte index and length.
-- 		When a character index is used where a character does not

-- <		results in 'a'.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.strcharpart(str, start, len) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the number of characters

-- 		When {skipcc} set to 1, Composing characters are ignored.
-- 		Also see |strlen()|, |strdisplaywidth()| and |strwidth()|.
--
-- 		{skipcc} is only available after 7.4.755.  For backward
-- 		compatibility, you can define a wrapper function: >

-- 		      function s:strchars(str, skipcc)
-- 			return strchars(a:str, a:skipcc)

-- Set option or local variable {varname} in buffer {expr} to

-- 		This also works for a global or local window option, but it
-- 		doesn't work for a global or local window variable.
-- 		For a local window option the global value is unchanged.
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
-- 		Note that the variable name without "b:" must be used.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:call setbufvar(1, "&mod", 1)
-- 			:call setbufvar("todo", "myvar", "foobar")

-- The result is a String, which is whatever the user typed on

--
-- 		In the second form it accepts a single dictionary with the
-- 		following keys, any of which may be omitted:
--
-- 		Key           Default  Description ~
-- 		prompt        ""       Same as {prompt} in the first form.
-- 		default       ""       Same as {text} in the first form.
-- 		completion    nothing  Same as {completion} in the first form.
-- 		cancelreturn  ""       Same as {cancelreturn} from
-- 		                       |inputdialog()|. Also works with
-- 		                       input().
-- 		highlight     nothing  Highlight handler: |Funcref|.
--
-- 		The highlighting set with |:echohl| is used for the prompt.
-- 		The input is entered just like a command-line, with the same
-- 		editing commands and mappings.  There is a separate history
-- 		for lines typed for input().
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:if input("Coffee or beer? ") == "beer"
-- 			:  echo "Cheers!"
-- 			:endif
-- <
-- 		If the optional {text} argument is present and not empty, this
-- 		is used for the default reply, as if the user typed this.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let color = input("Color? ", "white")
--
-- <		The optional {completion} argument specifies the type of
-- 		completion supported for the input.  Without it completion is
-- 		not performed.  The supported completion types are the same as
-- 		that can be supplied to a user-defined command using the
-- 		"-complete=" argument.  Refer to |:command-completion| for
-- 		more information.  Example: >
-- 			let fname = input("File: ", "", "file")
--
-- <					*input()-highlight* *E5400* *E5402*
-- 		The optional `highlight` key allows specifying function which
-- 		will be used for highlighting user input.  This function
-- 		receives user input as its only argument and must return
-- 		a list of 3-tuples [hl_start_col, hl_end_col + 1, hl_group]
-- 		where
-- 			hl_start_col is the first highlighted column,
-- 			hl_end_col is the last highlighted column (+ 1!),
-- 			hl_group is |:hi| group used for highlighting.
-- 					      *E5403* *E5404* *E5405* *E5406*
-- 		Both hl_start_col and hl_end_col + 1 must point to the start
-- 		of the multibyte character (highlighting must not break
-- 		multibyte characters), hl_end_col + 1 may be equal to the
-- 		input length.  Start column must be in range [0, len(input)),
-- 		end column must be in range (hl_start_col, len(input)],
-- 		sections must be ordered so that next hl_start_col is greater
-- 		then or equal to previous hl_end_col.
--
-- 		Example (try some input with parentheses): >
-- 			highlight RBP1 guibg=Red ctermbg=red
-- 			highlight RBP2 guibg=Yellow ctermbg=yellow
-- 			highlight RBP3 guibg=Green ctermbg=green
-- 			highlight RBP4 guibg=Blue ctermbg=blue
-- 			let g:rainbow_levels = 4

-- 			      call add(ret, [i, i + 1, 'RBP' . ((lvl % g:rainbow_levels) + 1)])
-- 			    endif
-- 			    let i += 1
-- 			  endwhile
-- 			  return ret
-- 			endfunction
-- 			call input({'prompt':'>','highlight':'RainbowParens'})
-- <
-- 		Highlight function is called at least once for each new
-- 		displayed input string, before command-line is redrawn.  It is
-- 		expected that function is pure for the duration of one input()
-- 		call, i.e. it produces the same output for the same input, so
-- 		output may be memoized.  Function is run like under |:silent|
-- 		modifier. If the function causes any errors, it will be
-- 		skipped for the duration of the current input() call.
--
-- 		Highlighting is disabled if command-line contains arabic
-- 		characters.
--
-- 		NOTE: This function must not be used in a startup file, for
-- 		the versions that only run in GUI mode (e.g., the Win32 GUI).
-- 		Note: When input() is called from within a mapping it will
-- 		consume remaining characters from that mapping, because a
-- 		mapping is handled like the characters were typed.
-- 		Use |inputsave()| before input() and |inputrestore()|
-- 		after input() to avoid that.  Another solution is to avoid
-- 		that further characters follow in the mapping, e.g., by using
-- 		|:execute| or |:normal|.
--
-- 		Example with a mapping: >
-- 			:nmap \x :call GetFoo()<CR>:exe "/" . Foo<CR>
-- 			:function GetFoo()
-- 			:  call inputsave()
-- 			:  let g:Foo = input("enter search pattern: ")

-- 		When {flags} contains "b" then binary mode is used: There will
-- 		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
-- 		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.
--
-- 		When {flags} contains "a" then append mode is used, lines are
-- 		appended to the file: >
-- 			:call writefile(["foo"], "event.log", "a")
-- 			:call writefile(["bar"], "event.log", "a")
-- <
-- 		When {flags} contains "S" fsync() call is not used, with "s"
-- 		it is used, 'fsync' option applies by default. No fsync()
-- 		means that writefile() will finish faster, but writes may be
-- 		left in OS buffers and not yet written to disk. Such changes
-- 		will disappear if system crashes before OS does writing.
--
-- 		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
-- 		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
-- 		to writefile().
-- 		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
-- 		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
-- 		error message if the file can't be created or when writing

--
-- 		chansend() writes raw data, not RPC messages.  If the channel

-- 		Limitations:

-- 		   (|msgpack-special-map|).
-- 		2. Since the parser aims to preserve all data untouched
-- 		   (except for 1.) some strings are parsed to

-- 							*msgpack-special-dict*
-- 		Some messagepack strings may be parsed to special
-- 		dictionaries. Special dictionaries are dictionaries which
--
-- 		1. Contain exactly two keys: `_TYPE` and `_VAL`.
-- 		2. `_TYPE` key is one of the types found in |v:msgpack_types|

-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use
-- 			code like >
-- 				_VAL[0] * ((_VAL[1] << 62)
-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in

-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
