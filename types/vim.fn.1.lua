-- 		effect if {buf} has 'buftype' set to "prompt".
--
-- 		The callback is invoked when pressing Enter.  The current
-- 		buffer will always be the prompt buffer.  A new line for a
-- 		prompt is added before invoking the callback, thus the prompt
-- 		for which the callback was invoked will be in the last but one
-- 		line.
-- 		If the callback wants to add text to the buffer, it must
-- 		insert it above the last line, since that is where the current
-- 		prompt is.  This can also be done asynchronously.
-- 		The callback is invoked with one argument, which is the text
-- 		that was entered at the prompt.  This can be an empty string
-- 		if the user only typed Enter.
-- 		Example: >

-- 		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
-- 		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].

-- Return the tangent of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|

-- 		    "l" or "V"	      |linewise| mode
-- 		    "b" or "<CTRL-V>" |blockwise-visual| mode
-- 		If a number immediately follows "b" or "<CTRL-V>" then this is
-- 		used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
-- 		then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
-- 		in the longest line (counting a <Tab> as 1 character).
-- 		If {options} contains "u" or '"', then the unnamed register is
-- 		set to point to register {regname}.
--
-- 		If {options} contains no register settings, then the default
-- 		is to use character mode unless {value} ends in a <NL> for
-- 		string {value} and linewise mode for list {value}. Blockwise
-- 		mode is never selected automatically.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.

-- 		Note: you may not use |List| containing more than one item to

function vim.fn.popup_notification(what, options) end

-- When {expected} and {actual} are not equal an error message is

-- 		from the Number 4.  And the number 4 is different from the
-- 		Float 4.0.  The value of 'ignorecase' is not used here, case
-- 		always matters.
-- 		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected
-- 		{expected} but got {actual}" is produced.
-- 		Example: >
-- 	assert_equal('foo', 'bar')
-- <		Will result in a string to be added to |v:errors|:
-- 	test.vim line 12: Expected 'foo' but got 'bar' ~
--- @return number

-- The result is the swap file path of the buffer {expr}.
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.

-- 		|:swapname| (unless no swap file).
-- 		If buffer {expr} has no swap file, returns an empty string.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.swapname(expr) end

-- The result is a Number which is the state of the modifiers for

-- 		These values are added together:
-- 			2	shift
-- 			4	control
-- 			8	alt (meta)
-- 			16	meta (when it's different from ALT)
-- 			32	mouse double click
-- 			64	mouse triple click
-- 			96	mouse quadruple click (== 32 + 64)
-- 			128	command (Macintosh only)
-- 		Only the modifiers that have not been included in the
-- 		character itself are obtained.  Thus Shift-a results in "A"
-- 		without a modifier.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.getcharmod() end

-- When {expr} is a |List| then this returns the index of the
-- 		first item where {pat} matches.  Each item is used as a
-- 		String, |Lists| and |Dictionaries| are used as echoed.
--
-- 		Otherwise, {expr} is used as a String.  The result is a
-- 		Number, which gives the index (byte offset) in {expr} where
-- 		{pat} matches.
--
-- 		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
-- 		If there is no match -1 is returned.
--
-- 		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
-- 			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
-- <		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.
-- 								*strpbrk()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strpbrk() function.  But you can do: >
-- 			:let sepidx = match(line, '[.,;: \t]')
-- <								*strcasestr()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
-- 		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >
-- 			:let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
-- <
-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
-- 		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
-- 		The result, however, is still the index counted from the
-- 		first character/item.  Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

-- The result is a String, which is a copy of {expr}, in which
-- 		the first match of {pat} is replaced with {sub}.
-- 		When {flags} is "g", all matches of {pat} in {expr} are
-- 		replaced.  Otherwise {flags} should be "".
--
-- 		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
-- 		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
-- 		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
-- 		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
-- 		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
-- 		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
-- 		used.
--
-- 		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
-- 		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
-- 		|sub-replace-special|.  For example, to replace something with
-- 		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.
--
-- 		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
-- 		unmodified.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
-- <		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
-- 			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
-- <		results in "TESTING".
--
-- 		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as
-- 		an expression. See |sub-replace-expression|.  Example: >
-- 			:echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)',
-- 			   \ '\=nr2char("0x" . submatch(1))', 'g')
--
-- <		When {sub} is a Funcref that function is called, with one
-- 		optional argument.  Example: >
-- 		   :echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)', SubNr, 'g')
-- <		The optional argument is a list which contains the whole
-- 		matched string and up to nine submatches, like what

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they

-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in

--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.
--
-- 		Return value is always 0.

-- 		or buffer-local variable.
-- 		When the tab, window or variable doesn't exist {def} or an
-- 		empty string is returned, there is no error message.
-- 		Examples: >

--

-- 		    a:bufnr	the buffer that was changed
-- 		    a:start	first changed line number
-- 		    a:end	first line number below the change
-- 		    a:added	number of lines added, negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    a:changes	a List of items with details about the changes
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 	    func Listener(bufnr, start, end, added, changes)
-- 	      echo 'lines ' .. a:start .. ' until ' .. a:end .. ' changed'
-- 	    endfunc
-- 	    call listener_add('Listener', bufnr)
--
-- <		The List cannot be changed.  Each item in a:changes is a
-- 		dictionary with these entries:
-- 		    lnum	the first line number of the change
-- 		    end		the first line below the change
-- 		    added	number of lines added; negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    col		first column in "lnum" that was affected by
-- 				the change; one if unknown or the whole line
-- 				was affected; this is a byte index, first
-- 				character has a value of one.
-- 		When lines are inserted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	line above which the new line is added
-- 		    end		equal to "lnum"
-- 		    added	number of lines inserted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are deleted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	the first deleted line
-- 		    end		the line below the first deleted line, before
-- 				the deletion was done
-- 		    added	negative, number of lines deleted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are changed:
-- 		    lnum	the first changed line
-- 		    end		the line below the last changed line
-- 		    added	0
-- 		    col		first column with a change or 1
--
-- 		The entries are in the order the changes were made, thus the
-- 		most recent change is at the end.  The line numbers are valid
-- 		when the callback is invoked, but later changes may make them
-- 		invalid, thus keeping a copy for later might not work.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked just before the screen is updated,
-- 		when |listener_flush()| is called or when a change is being
-- 		made that changes the line count in a way it causes a line
-- 		number in the list of changes to become invalid.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with the text locked, see
-- 		|textlock|.  If you do need to make changes to the buffer, use
-- 		a timer to do this later |timer_start()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is not invoked when the buffer is first loaded.
-- 		Use the |BufReadPost| autocmd event to handle the initial text
-- 		of a buffer.
-- 		The {callback} is also not invoked when the buffer is
-- 		unloaded, use the |BufUnload| autocmd event for that.
--

-- 		Not to be used for interactive commands.
--
-- 		If {input} is a string it is written to a pipe and passed as

-- 		items converted to NULs).
-- 		When {input} is given and is a valid buffer id, the content of
-- 		the buffer is written to the file line by line, each line
-- 		terminated by NL (and NUL where the text has NL).
-- 								*E5677*
-- 		Note: system() cannot write to or read from backgrounded ("&")

-- 		|fnamemodify()| to escape special characters in a command
-- 		argument.  Newlines in {cmd} may cause the command to fail.
-- 		The characters in 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' may also

-- 		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
-- 		  %G	floating point number, as %F or %E depending on value
-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.
--
-- 		i	alias for d
-- 		D	alias for ld
-- 		U	alias for lu
-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.

-- When exiting Vim or trying to close the terminal window in

-- Send the {string} to {server}.  The string is sent as an

-- 		When {varname} is equal to "&" returns a dictionary with all

-- 		window-local option.
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
-- 		When the buffer or variable doesn't exist {def} or an empty

--
-- 		When {expr} starts with '%', '#' or '<', the expansion is done

-- 			#		alternate file name
-- 			#n		alternate file name n
-- 			<cfile>		file name under the cursor
-- 			<afile>		autocmd file name
-- 			<abuf>		autocmd buffer number (as a String!)
-- 			<amatch>	autocmd matched name
-- 			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in
-- 					a function
-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor
-- 			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
-- 			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received
-- 					message |server2client()|
-- 		Modifiers:
-- 			:p		expand to full path
-- 			:h		head (last path component removed)
-- 			:t		tail (last path component only)
-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &tags = expand("%:p:h") . "/tags"
-- <		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
-- 		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >
-- 			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
-- <		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
-- 		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
-- 		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
-- 		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >
-- 			:echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
-- <
-- 		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
-- 		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
-- 		to modify normal file names.
--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
-- 		{nosuf} argument is given and it is |TRUE|.
-- 		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
-- 		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
-- 		all "README" files in the current directory and below: >
-- 			:echo expand("**/README")
-- <
-- 		expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
-- 		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
-- 		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
-- 		|expr-env-expand|.
-- 		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
-- 		names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
-- 		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
-- 		"$FOOBAR".
--
-- 		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for

-- 		{expr} can be initialized by |srand()| and will be updated by
-- 		rand().  If {expr} is omitted, an internal seed value is used
-- 		and updated.
--
-- 		Examples: >

-- 			:let seed = srand()
-- 			:echo rand(seed)
-- 			:echo rand(seed) % 16  " random number 0 - 15

--- @return none
function vim.fn.term_sendkeys(buf, keys) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the translated syntax ID of

--- @return number
function vim.fn.synIDtrans(synID) end

-- Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a
-- 		"match").  It will be highlighted with {group}.  Returns an
-- 		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
-- 		match using |matchdelete()|.
-- 		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
-- 		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
-- 		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
-- 		The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
-- 		concealed.
--
-- 		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
-- 		match.  A match with a high priority will have its
-- 		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
-- 		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
-- 		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
-- 		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
-- 		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
-- 		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
-- 		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
-- 		always overrule syntax highlighting.
--
-- 		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
-- 		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
-- 		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
-- 		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
-- 		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
-- 		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified or -1,
-- 		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.
--
-- 		The optional {dict} argument allows for further custom
-- 		values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
-- 		conceal character that will be shown for |hl-Conceal|
-- 		highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
--
-- 			conceal	    Special character to show instead of the
-- 				    match (only for |hl-Conceal| highlighed
-- 				    matches, see |:syn-cchar|)
-- 			window	    Instead of the current window use the
-- 				    window with this number or window ID.
--
-- 		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
-- 		the |:match| commands.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)
--
-- <		A list of matches defined by |matchadd()| and |:match| are
-- 		available from |getmatches()|.  All matches can be deleted in
-- 		one operation by |clearmatches()|.

-- Set the matches for Insert mode completion.
-- 		Can only be used in Insert mode.  You need to use a mapping
-- 		with CTRL-R = (see |i_CTRL-R|).  It does not work after CTRL-O
-- 		or with an expression mapping.
-- 		{startcol} is the byte offset in the line where the completed
-- 		text start.  The text up to the cursor is the original text
-- 		that will be replaced by the matches.  Use col('.') for an
-- 		empty string.  "col('.') - 1" will replace one character by a
-- 		match.
-- 		{matches} must be a |List|.  Each |List| item is one match.
-- 		See |complete-items| for the kind of items that are possible.
-- 		Note that the after calling this function you need to avoid
-- 		inserting anything that would cause completion to stop.
-- 		The match can be selected with CTRL-N and CTRL-P as usual with
-- 		Insert mode completion.  The popup menu will appear if
-- 		specified, see |ins-completion-menu|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 	inoremap <F5> <C-R>=ListMonths()<CR>
--
-- 	func! ListMonths()
-- 	  call complete(col('.'), ['January', 'February', 'March',
-- 		\ 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September',
-- 		\ 'October', 'November', 'December'])
-- 	  return ''
-- 	endfunc
-- <		This isn't very useful, but it shows how it works.  Note that

--- @return none
function vim.fn.complete(startcol, matches) end

-- Return the cosine of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|.
-- 		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >

-- <			0.862319 >
-- 			:echo cos(-4.01)
-- <			-0.646043
--- @return float
function vim.fn.cos(expr) end

-- The result is a List with currently three items:
-- 		1. The first item in the list is 0 if the character at the
-- 		   position {lnum} and {col} is not part of a concealable
-- 		   region, 1 if it is.
-- 		2. The second item in the list is a string. If the first item
-- 		   is 1, the second item contains the text which will be
-- 		   displayed in place of the concealed text, depending on the
-- 		   current setting of 'conceallevel' and 'listchars'.
-- 		3. The third and final item in the list is a number
-- 		   representing the specific syntax region matched in the
-- 		   line. When the character is not concealed the value is
-- 		   zero. This allows detection of the beginning of a new
-- 		   concealable region if there are two consecutive regions
-- 		   with the same replacement character.  For an example, if
-- 		   the text is "123456" and both "23" and "45" are concealed
-- 		   and replaced by the character "X", then:
-- 			call			returns ~
-- 		   	synconcealed(lnum, 1)   [0, '', 0]

-- Search for the declaration of {name}.
--
-- 		With a non-zero {global} argument it works like |gD|, find

-- 		first match in the function.
--
-- 		With a non-zero {thisblock} argument matches in a {} block
-- 		that ends before the cursor position are ignored.  Avoids
-- 		finding variable declarations only valid in another scope.
--
-- 		Moves the cursor to the found match.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			if searchdecl('myvar') == 0
-- 			   echo getline('.')
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 							*searchpair()*
-- searchpair({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
-- 				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
-- 		Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
-- 		used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
-- 		if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
-- 		The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
-- 		forward, include 'b' in {flags} to search backward.
-- 		If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
-- 		line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
-- 		returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
-- 		given.
--
-- 		{start}, {middle} and {end} are patterns, see |pattern|.  They
-- 		must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
-- 		{middle} is not empty, it is found when searching from either
-- 		direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
-- 		typical use is: >
-- 			searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
-- <		By leaving {middle} empty the "else" is skipped.
--
-- 		{flags} 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
-- 		|search()|.  Additionally:
-- 		'r'	Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
-- 			outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
-- 		'm'	Return number of matches instead of line number with
-- 			the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
-- 		Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
-- 		avoid wrapping around the end of the file.
--
-- 		When a match for {start}, {middle} or {end} is found, the
-- 		{skip} expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
-- 		the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
-- 		match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
-- 		or a string.
-- 		When {skip} is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
-- 		When evaluating {skip} causes an error the search is aborted
-- 		and -1 returned.
--  		{skip} can be a string, a lambda, a funcref or a partial.
-- 		Anything else makes the function fail.
--
-- 		For {stopline} and {timeout} see |search()|.
--
-- 		The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
-- 		patterns are used like it's on.
--
-- 		The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
-- 		{start}, {middle} or {end} at the next character, in the
-- 		direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example: >
-- 			if 1
-- 			  if 2
-- 			  endif 2
-- 			endif 1
-- <		When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
-- 		searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
-- 		the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
-- 		found.  That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
-- 		then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
-- 		"endif 2".
-- 		When searching backwards and {end} is more than one character,
-- 		it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
-- 		that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
-- 		the matching start.
--
-- 		Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
-- 			\ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')
--
-- <		The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
-- 		to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
-- 		having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
-- 		catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
-- 		Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway through a line is considered
-- 		a match.
-- 		Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}": >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')
--
-- <		This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
-- 		match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
-- 		highlighting recognized as strings: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
-- 	     \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
-- <
-- 							*searchpairpos()*
-- searchpairpos({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
-- 				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
-- 		Same as |searchpair()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
-- 		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
-- 		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
-- 		the column position of the match.  If no match is found,
-- 		returns [0, 0]. >
--
-- 			:let [lnum,col] = searchpairpos('{', '', '}', 'n')
-- <

--
-- 		The optional {default} argument is the number of the choice
-- 		that is made if the user hits <CR>.  Use 1 to make the first
-- 		choice the default one.  Use 0 to not set a default.  If
-- 		{default} is omitted, 1 is used.
--
-- 		The optional {type} argument gives the type of dialog.  This
-- 		is only used for the icon of the Win32 GUI.  It can be one of
-- 		these values: "Error", "Question", "Info", "Warning" or
-- 		"Generic".  Only the first character is relevant.
-- 		When {type} is omitted, "Generic" is used.
--
-- 		If the user aborts the dialog by pressing <Esc>, CTRL-C,
-- 		or another valid interrupt key, confirm() returns 0.

--    :if choice == 0
--    :	echo "make up your mind!"

-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.

-- 		terminated forcedly (there is no "gentle" way).
-- 		This goes to the process group, thus children may also be
-- 		affected.
--
-- 		Effect for Unix:
-- 			"term"	 SIGTERM (default)
-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT
-- 			"kill"	 SIGKILL (strongest way to stop)

-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly
-- 			Others	 CTRL_BREAK
--
-- 		On Unix the signal is sent to the process group.  This means

-- 		|job_status()|.
--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be
-- 		sent.  This is to avoid to stop the wrong job (esp. on Unix,
-- 		where process numbers are recycled).

-- 			:let color = input("Color? ", "white")
--
-- <		The optional {completion} argument specifies the type of
-- 		completion supported for the input.  Without it completion is
-- 		not performed.  The supported completion types are the same as
-- 		that can be supplied to a user-defined command using the
-- 		"-complete=" argument.  Refer to |:command-completion| for
-- 		more information.  Example: >
-- 			let fname = input("File: ", "", "file")
--
-- <					*input()-highlight* *E5400* *E5402*
-- 		The optional `highlight` key allows specifying function which
-- 		will be used for highlighting user input.  This function
-- 		receives user input as its only argument and must return
-- 		a list of 3-tuples [hl_start_col, hl_end_col + 1, hl_group]
-- 		where
-- 			hl_start_col is the first highlighted column,
-- 			hl_end_col is the last highlighted column (+ 1!),
-- 			hl_group is |:hi| group used for highlighting.
-- 					      *E5403* *E5404* *E5405* *E5406*
-- 		Both hl_start_col and hl_end_col + 1 must point to the start
-- 		of the multibyte character (highlighting must not break
-- 		multibyte characters), hl_end_col + 1 may be equal to the
-- 		input length.  Start column must be in range [0, len(input)),
-- 		end column must be in range (hl_start_col, len(input)],
-- 		sections must be ordered so that next hl_start_col is greater
-- 		then or equal to previous hl_end_col.
--
-- 		Example (try some input with parentheses): >
-- 			highlight RBP1 guibg=Red ctermbg=red
-- 			highlight RBP2 guibg=Yellow ctermbg=yellow
-- 			highlight RBP3 guibg=Green ctermbg=green
-- 			highlight RBP4 guibg=Blue ctermbg=blue
-- 			let g:rainbow_levels = 4
-- 			function! RainbowParens(cmdline)
-- 			  let ret = []
-- 			  let i = 0
-- 			  let lvl = 0
-- 			  while i < len(a:cmdline)
-- 			    if a:cmdline[i] is# '('
-- 			      call add(ret, [i, i + 1, 'RBP' . ((lvl % g:rainbow_levels) + 1)])
-- 			      let lvl += 1
-- 			    elseif a:cmdline[i] is# ')'
-- 			      let lvl -= 1
-- 			      call add(ret, [i, i + 1, 'RBP' . ((lvl % g:rainbow_levels) + 1)])
-- 			    endif
-- 			    let i += 1
-- 			  endwhile
-- 			  return ret
-- 			endfunction
-- 			call input({'prompt':'>','highlight':'RainbowParens'})
-- <
-- 		Highlight function is called at least once for each new
-- 		displayed input string, before command-line is redrawn.  It is
-- 		expected that function is pure for the duration of one input()
-- 		call, i.e. it produces the same output for the same input, so
-- 		output may be memoized.  Function is run like under |:silent|
-- 		modifier. If the function causes any errors, it will be
-- 		skipped for the duration of the current input() call.
--
-- 		Highlighting is disabled if command-line contains arabic
-- 		characters.
--
-- 		NOTE: This function must not be used in a startup file, for
-- 		the versions that only run in GUI mode (e.g., the Win32 GUI).
-- 		Note: When input() is called from within a mapping it will
-- 		consume remaining characters from that mapping, because a
-- 		mapping is handled like the characters were typed.
-- 		Use |inputsave()| before input() and |inputrestore()|
-- 		after input() to avoid that.  Another solution is to avoid
-- 		that further characters follow in the mapping, e.g., by using
-- 		|:execute| or |:normal|.
--
-- 		Example with a mapping: >
-- 			:nmap \x :call GetFoo()<CR>:exe "/" . Foo<CR>
-- 			:function GetFoo()
-- 			:  call inputsave()
-- 			:  let g:Foo = input("enter search pattern: ")

--
-- 		For each timer the information is stored in a Dictionary with

-- 		    "time"	    time the timer was started with

--- @return list

-- The result is a Number, which gives the byte index in

-- 			:let colon1 = stridx(line, ":")
-- 			:let colon2 = stridx(line, ":", colon1 + 1)
-- <		The search is done case-sensitive.
-- 		For pattern searches use |match()|.
-- 		-1 is returned if the {needle} does not occur in {haystack}.

-- 		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "Start")    0
-- 		  :echo stridx("Starting point", "start")   -1

--
-- 		Use |ch_log()| to write log messages.  The file is flushed

--
-- 		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
-- 		NOTE: the channel communication is stored in the file, be

-- Move the Vim server with the name {server} to the foreground.
-- 		This works like: >
-- 			remote_expr({server}, "foreground()")
-- <		Except that on Win32 systems the client does the work, to work
-- 		around the problem that the OS doesn't always allow the server
-- 		to bring itself to the foreground.

-- 		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns

--
-- 		When substitute() is used recursively only the submatches in

-- 		"rwx" flags represent, in turn, the permissions of the owner
-- 		of the file, the group the file belongs to, and other users.
-- 		If a user does not have a given permission the flag for this
-- 		is replaced with the string "-".  Examples: >
-- 			:echo getfperm("/etc/passwd")
-- 			:echo getfperm(expand("~/.config/nvim/init.vim"))
-- <		This will hopefully (from a security point of view) display

--- @return list
function vim.fn.term_getsize(buf) end

-- Same as |search()|, but returns a |List| with the line and
-- 		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
-- 		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
-- 		the column position of the match. If no match is found,
-- 		returns [0, 0].
-- 		Example: >
-- 	:let [lnum, col] = searchpos('mypattern', 'n')
--
-- <		When the 'p' flag is given then there is an extra item with
-- 		the sub-pattern match number |search()-sub-match|.  Example: >
-- 	:let [lnum, col, submatch] = searchpos('\(\l\)\|\(\u\)', 'np')
-- <		In this example "submatch" is 2 when a lowercase letter is

-- {expr1} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
-- 		For each item in {expr1} evaluate {expr2} and when the result

-- 		{expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
-- 		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
-- 		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
-- 		the current item.
-- 		For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key of the current item.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
-- <		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
-- 			call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
-- <		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
-- 			call filter(var, 0)
-- <		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
-- 			1. the key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return |TRUE| if the item should be kept.
-- 		Example that keeps the odd items of a list: >
-- 			func Odd(idx, val)
-- 			  return a:idx % 2 == 1
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call filter(mylist, function('Odd'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx, val -> idx * val <= 42})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx -> idx % 2 == 1})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
-- 		further items in {expr1} are processed. When {expr2} is a
-- 		Funcref errors inside a function are ignored, unless it was
-- 		defined with the "abort" flag.

function vim.fn.filter(expr1, expr2) end

-- The result is a String, which describes the last Visual mode

-- 		character-wise, line-wise, or block-wise Visual mode
-- 		respectively.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:exe "normal " . visualmode()
-- <		This enters the same Visual mode as before.  It is also useful
-- 		in scripts if you wish to act differently depending on the

-- 		If Visual mode is active, use |mode()| to get the Visual mode
-- 		(e.g., in a |:vmap|).
-- 		If [expr] is supplied and it evaluates to a non-zero Number or

-- Get information about buffers as a List of Dictionaries.

-- 			listed		TRUE if the buffer is listed.
-- 			lnum		current line number in buffer.
-- 			linecount	number of lines in the buffer (only
-- 					valid when loaded)
-- 			loaded		TRUE if the buffer is loaded.
-- 			name		full path to the file in the buffer.
-- 			signs		list of signs placed in the buffer.
-- 					Each list item is a dictionary with
-- 					the following fields:
-- 					    id	  sign identifier
-- 					    lnum  line number
-- 					    name  sign name
-- 			variables	a reference to the dictionary with

-- Calls many API methods atomically.
--
--                 This has two main usages:
--                 1. To perform several requests from an async context
--                    atomically, i.e. without interleaving redraws, RPC requests
--                    from other clients, or user interactions (however API
--                    methods may trigger autocommands or event processing which
--                    have such side-effects, e.g. |:sleep| may wake timers).
--                 2. To minimize RPC overhead (roundtrips) of a sequence of many
--                    requests.
--
--                 Parameters: ~
--                     {calls}  an array of calls, where each call is described
--                              by an array with two elements: the request name,
--                              and an array of arguments.
--
--                 Return: ~
--                     Array of two elements. The first is an array of return
--                     values. The second is NIL if all calls succeeded. If a
--                     call resulted in an error, it is a three-element array
--                     with the zero-based index of the call which resulted in an
--                     error, the error type and the error message. If an error
--                     occurred, the values from all preceding calls will still
--                     be returned.

-- 		the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the number of the buffer in the current

-- Clear {history}, i.e. delete all its entries.  See |hist-names|
-- 		for the possible values of {history}.
--
-- 		If the parameter {item} evaluates to a String, it is used as a
-- 		regular expression.  All entries matching that expression will
-- 		be removed from the history (if there are any).
-- 		Upper/lowercase must match, unless "\c" is used |/\c|.
-- 		If {item} evaluates to a Number, it will be interpreted as
-- 		an index, see |:history-indexing|.  The respective entry will
-- 		be removed if it exists.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 for a successful operation,
-- 		otherwise 0 is returned.
--
-- 		Examples:
-- 		Clear expression register history: >
-- 			:call histdel("expr")
-- <
-- 		Remove all entries starting with "*" from the search history: >
-- 			:call histdel("/", '^\*')
-- <
-- 		The following three are equivalent: >

-- 			:call histdel("search", -1)
-- 			:call histdel("search", '^'.histget("search", -1).'$')
-- <
-- 		To delete the last search pattern and use the last-but-one for
-- 		the "n" command and 'hlsearch': >
-- 			:call histdel("search", -1)
-- 			:let @/ = histget("search", -1)
