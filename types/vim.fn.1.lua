-- Returns a list of tags matching the regular expression {expr}.
--
-- 		If {filename} is passed it is used to prioritize the results
-- 		in the same way that |:tselect| does. See |tag-priority|.
-- 		{filename} should be the full path of the file.
--
-- 		Each list item is a dictionary with at least the following
-- 		entries:
-- 			name		Name of the tag.
-- 			filename	Name of the file where the tag is
-- 					defined.  It is either relative to the
-- 					current directory or a full path.
-- 			cmd		Ex command used to locate the tag in
-- 					the file.
-- 			kind		Type of the tag.  The value for this
-- 					entry depends on the language specific
-- 					kind values.  Only available when
-- 					using a tags file generated by
-- 					Exuberant ctags or hdrtag.
-- 			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to
-- 					|static-tag| for more information.
-- 		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
-- 		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
-- 		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
-- 		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
-- 		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is
-- 		contained in.
--
-- 		The ex-command "cmd" can be either an ex search pattern, a
-- 		line number or a line number followed by a byte number.
--
-- 		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.
--
-- 		To get an exact tag match, the anchors '^' and '$' should be
-- 		used in {expr}.  This also make the function work faster.
-- 		Refer to |tag-regexp| for more information about the tag
-- 		search regular expression pattern.

-- Adds a watcher to a dictionary. A dictionary watcher is
-- 		identified by three components:
--
-- 		- A dictionary({dict});
-- 		- A key pattern({pattern}).
-- 		- A function({callback}).
--
-- 		After this is called, every change on {dict} and on keys
-- 		matching {pattern} will result in {callback} being invoked.
--
-- 		For example, to watch all global variables: >
-- 			silent! call dictwatcherdel(g:, '*', 'OnDictChanged')
-- 			function! OnDictChanged(d,k,z)
-- 			  echomsg string(a:k) string(a:z)
-- 			endfunction
-- 			call dictwatcheradd(g:, '*', 'OnDictChanged')
-- <
-- 		For now {pattern} only accepts very simple patterns that can
-- 		contain a '*' at the end of the string, in which case it will
-- 		match every key that begins with the substring before the '*'.
-- 		That means if '*' is not the last character of {pattern}, only
-- 		keys that are exactly equal as {pattern} will be matched.
--
-- 		The {callback} receives three arguments:
--
-- 		- The dictionary being watched.
-- 		- The key which changed.
-- 		- A dictionary containing the new and old values for the key.
--
-- 		The type of change can be determined by examining the keys
-- 		present on the third argument:
--
-- 		- If contains both `old` and `new`, the key was updated.
-- 		- If it contains only `new`, the key was added.
-- 		- If it contains only `old`, the key was deleted.
--
-- 		This function can be used by plugins to implement options with
-- 		validation and parsing logic.

-- Call function {funcname} in the run-time library {libname}
-- 		with single argument {argument}.
-- 		This is useful to call functions in a library that you
-- 		especially made to be used with Vim.  Since only one argument
-- 		is possible, calling standard library functions is rather
-- 		limited.
-- 		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the
-- 		function returns NULL, this will appear as an empty string ""
-- 		to Vim.
-- 		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
-- 		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
-- 		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a
-- 		null-terminated string.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
-- 		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
-- 		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

-- 			curscol	cursor screen column
-- 		If the specified position is not visible, all values are zero.
-- 		The "endcol" value differs from "col" when the character

-- 		be 1 and "endcol" can be 8.
-- 		The "curscol" value is where the cursor would be placed.  For

--- @return dict

-- The result is a Number, which is the screen column of the file
-- 		position given with {expr}.  That is, the last screen position
-- 		occupied by the character at that position, when the screen
-- 		would be of unlimited width.  When there is a <Tab> at the
-- 		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
-- 		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
-- 		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
-- 		For the byte position use |col()|.
-- 		For the use of {expr} see |col()|.
-- 		When 'virtualedit' is used {expr} can be [lnum, col, off], where
-- 		"off" is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.  When "off" is omitted zero is used.
-- 		When Virtual editing is active in the current mode, a position
-- 		beyond the end of the line can be returned. |'virtualedit'|
-- 		The accepted positions are:
-- 		    .	    the cursor position
-- 		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
-- 			    number of displayed characters in the cursor line
-- 			    plus one)
-- 		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
-- 			    returned)
-- 		    v       In Visual mode: the start of the Visual area (the
-- 			    cursor is the end).  When not in Visual mode
-- 			    returns the cursor position.  Differs from |'<| in
-- 			    that it's updated right away.
-- 		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
-- 		Examples: >
--   virtcol(".")	   with text "foo^Lbar", with cursor on the "^L", returns 5
--   virtcol("$")	   with text "foo^Lbar", returns 9

-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]
--
-- 		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the
-- 		current buffer.  When setting an uppercase mark "bufnum" is
-- 		used for the mark position.  For other marks it specifies the
-- 		buffer to set the mark in.  You can use the |bufnr()| function
-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,
-- 		since these are associated with a window, not a buffer.
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
-- 		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
-- 		before '>.
--
-- 		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
-- 		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.
--
-- 		Also see |getpos()| and |getcurpos()|.
--
-- 		This does not restore the preferred column for moving
-- 		vertically; if you set the cursor position with this, |j| and

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they

--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes

-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.

-- 		- If {action} is set to 't', then all the entries from the

-- 		  removed and then new entries are pushed to the stack.
--
-- 		The current index is set to one after the length of the tag

-- Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the
-- 		cursor position (you can use |cursor()| to set it).
--
-- 		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
-- 		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
-- 		move.  No error message is given.
--
-- 		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'b'	search Backward instead of forward
-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
-- 		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
-- 		    :  normal G$
-- 		    :  let flags = "w"
-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.

-- 		3. The third and final item in the list is a number

-- Start a job and return a Job object.  Unlike |system()| and

-- 		To start a job in a terminal window see |term_start()|.
--
-- 		If the job fails to start then |job_status()| on the returned
-- 		Job object results in "fail" and none of the callbacks will be
-- 		invoked.
--
-- 		{command} can be a String.  This works best on MS-Windows.  On
-- 		Unix it is split up in white-separated parts to be passed to
-- 		execvp().  Arguments in double quotes can contain white space.
--
-- 		{command} can be a List, where the first item is the executable
-- 		and further items are the arguments.  All items are converted
-- 		to String.  This works best on Unix.
--
-- 		On MS-Windows, job_start() makes a GUI application hidden. If
-- 		want to show it, Use |:!start| instead.
--
-- 		The command is executed directly, not through a shell, the
-- 		'shell' option is not used.  To use the shell: >
-- 	let job = job_start(["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo hello"])
-- <		Or: >
-- 	let job = job_start('/bin/sh -c "echo hello"')
-- <		Note that this will start two processes, the shell and the
-- 		command it executes.  If you don't want this use the "exec"
-- 		shell command.
--
-- 		On Unix $PATH is used to search for the executable only when
-- 		the command does not contain a slash.
--
-- 		The job will use the same terminal as Vim.  If it reads from
-- 		stdin the job and Vim will be fighting over input, that
-- 		doesn't work.  Redirect stdin and stdout to avoid problems: >
-- 	let job = job_start(['sh', '-c', "myserver </dev/null >/dev/null"])
-- <
-- 		The returned Job object can be used to get the status with
-- 		|job_status()| and stop the job with |job_stop()|.
--
-- 		Note that the job object will be deleted if there are no
-- 		references to it.  This closes the stdin and stderr, which may
-- 		cause the job to fail with an error.  To avoid this keep a
-- 		reference to the job.  Thus instead of: >
-- 	call job_start('my-command')
-- <		use: >
-- 	let myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <		and unlet "myjob" once the job is not needed or is past the
-- 		point where it would fail (e.g. when it prints a message on
-- 		startup).  Keep in mind that variables local to a function
-- 		will cease to exist if the function returns.  Use a
-- 		script-local variable if needed: >
-- 	let s:myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <
-- 		{options} must be a Dictionary.  It can contain many optional

-- 		argument is ignored, thus you can always give it.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and |TRUE|, the result type is changed
-- 		to |List|. Each list item is one text line. Use it if you care
-- 		about zero bytes possibly present inside register: without
-- 		third argument both NLs and zero bytes are represented as NLs
-- 		(see |NL-used-for-Nul|).
-- 		When the register was not set an empty list is returned.

-- The result is a String, which is whatever the user typed on

--
-- 		In the second form it accepts a single dictionary with the

--
-- 		Key           Default  Description ~

-- 		default       ""       Same as {text} in the first form.
-- 		completion    nothing  Same as {completion} in the first form.
-- 		cancelreturn  ""       Same as {cancelreturn} from
-- 		                       |inputdialog()|. Also works with
-- 		                       input().
-- 		highlight     nothing  Highlight handler: |Funcref|.
--
-- 		The highlighting set with |:echohl| is used for the prompt.
-- 		The input is entered just like a command-line, with the same
-- 		editing commands and mappings.  There is a separate history
-- 		for lines typed for input().
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:if input("Coffee or beer? ") == "beer"
-- 			:  echo "Cheers!"
-- 			:endif
-- <
-- 		If the optional {text} argument is present and not empty, this
-- 		is used for the default reply, as if the user typed this.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let color = input("Color? ", "white")
--
-- <		The optional {completion} argument specifies the type of
-- 		completion supported for the input.  Without it completion is
-- 		not performed.  The supported completion types are the same as
-- 		that can be supplied to a user-defined command using the
-- 		"-complete=" argument.  Refer to |:command-completion| for
-- 		more information.  Example: >
-- 			let fname = input("File: ", "", "file")
--
-- <					*input()-highlight* *E5400* *E5402*
-- 		The optional `highlight` key allows specifying function which
-- 		will be used for highlighting user input.  This function
-- 		receives user input as its only argument and must return
-- 		a list of 3-tuples [hl_start_col, hl_end_col + 1, hl_group]
-- 		where
-- 			hl_start_col is the first highlighted column,
-- 			hl_end_col is the last highlighted column (+ 1!),
-- 			hl_group is |:hi| group used for highlighting.
-- 					      *E5403* *E5404* *E5405* *E5406*
-- 		Both hl_start_col and hl_end_col + 1 must point to the start
-- 		of the multibyte character (highlighting must not break
-- 		multibyte characters), hl_end_col + 1 may be equal to the
-- 		input length.  Start column must be in range [0, len(input)),
-- 		end column must be in range (hl_start_col, len(input)],
-- 		sections must be ordered so that next hl_start_col is greater
-- 		then or equal to previous hl_end_col.
--
-- 		Example (try some input with parentheses): >
-- 			highlight RBP1 guibg=Red ctermbg=red
-- 			highlight RBP2 guibg=Yellow ctermbg=yellow
-- 			highlight RBP3 guibg=Green ctermbg=green
-- 			highlight RBP4 guibg=Blue ctermbg=blue
-- 			let g:rainbow_levels = 4
-- 			function! RainbowParens(cmdline)
-- 			  let ret = []
-- 			  let i = 0
-- 			  let lvl = 0

-- 			      call add(ret, [i, i + 1, 'RBP' . ((lvl % g:rainbow_levels) + 1)])
-- 			    endif
-- 			    let i += 1
-- 			  endwhile
-- 			  return ret
-- 			endfunction
-- 			call input({'prompt':'>','highlight':'RainbowParens'})
-- <
-- 		Highlight function is called at least once for each new
-- 		displayed input string, before command-line is redrawn.  It is
-- 		expected that function is pure for the duration of one input()
-- 		call, i.e. it produces the same output for the same input, so
-- 		output may be memoized.  Function is run like under |:silent|
-- 		modifier. If the function causes any errors, it will be
-- 		skipped for the duration of the current input() call.
--
-- 		Highlighting is disabled if command-line contains arabic
-- 		characters.
--
-- 		NOTE: This function must not be used in a startup file, for
-- 		the versions that only run in GUI mode (e.g., the Win32 GUI).
-- 		Note: When input() is called from within a mapping it will
-- 		consume remaining characters from that mapping, because a
-- 		mapping is handled like the characters were typed.
-- 		Use |inputsave()| before input() and |inputrestore()|
-- 		after input() to avoid that.  Another solution is to avoid
-- 		that further characters follow in the mapping, e.g., by using
-- 		|:execute| or |:normal|.
--
-- 		Example with a mapping: >
-- 			:nmap \x :call GetFoo()<CR>:exe "/" . Foo<CR>
-- 			:function GetFoo()
-- 			:  call inputsave()
-- 			:  let g:Foo = input("enter search pattern: ")

-- 		Note that a NL in the string can stand for a line break of a
-- 		multi-line match or a NUL character in the text.
-- 		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns
-- 		a list of strings, similar to |getline()| with two arguments.
-- 		NL characters in the text represent NUL characters in the
-- 		text.
-- 		Only returns more than one item for |:substitute|, inside
-- 		|substitute()| this list will always contain one or zero
-- 		items, since there are no real line breaks.
--
-- 		When substitute() is used recursively only the submatches in
-- 		the current (deepest) call can be obtained.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:s/\d\+/\=submatch(0) + 1/
-- 			:echo substitute(text, '\d\+', '\=submatch(0) + 1', '')
-- <		This finds the first number in the line and adds one to it.

-- 		{startcol} is the byte offset in the line where the completed
-- 		text start.  The text up to the cursor is the original text
-- 		that will be replaced by the matches.  Use col('.') for an
-- 		empty string.  "col('.') - 1" will replace one character by a
-- 		match.
-- 		{matches} must be a |List|.  Each |List| item is one match.
-- 		See |complete-items| for the kind of items that are possible.
-- 		Note that the after calling this function you need to avoid
-- 		inserting anything that would cause completion to stop.
-- 		The match can be selected with CTRL-N and CTRL-P as usual with
-- 		Insert mode completion.  The popup menu will appear if
-- 		specified, see |ins-completion-menu|.

-- 		and so on.  Exactly like the unix "tr" command.
-- 		This code also deals with multibyte characters properly.
--
-- 		Examples: >

-- 		Composing characters are not counted separately, their byte
-- 		length is added to the preceding base character.  See
-- 		|byteidxcomp()| below for counting composing characters
-- 		separately.
-- 		Example : >

-- 		the magnitude of {expr2}.  If {expr2} is zero, the value
-- 		returned is zero.  The value returned is a |Float|.
-- 		{expr1} and {expr2} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >

-- <		The same can be done (slowly) with: >
-- 			join(map(list, {nr, val -> nr2char(val)}), '')
-- <		|str2list()| does the opposite.
--
-- 		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.

-- 		command.
--
-- 		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|

-- 		is removed.
-- 		Note that Vim does not know when the text received on a raw
-- 		channel is complete, it may only return the first part and you
-- 		need to use |ch_readraw()| to fetch the rest.

-- Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a

-- 		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
-- 		match using |matchdelete()|.
-- 		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
-- 		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
-- 		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
-- 		The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
-- 		concealed.
--
-- 		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
-- 		match.  A match with a high priority will have its
-- 		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
-- 		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
-- 		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
-- 		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
-- 		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
-- 		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
-- 		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
-- 		always overrule syntax highlighting.
--
-- 		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
-- 		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
-- 		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
-- 		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
-- 		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
-- 		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified or -1,
-- 		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.
--
-- 		The optional {dict} argument allows for further custom
-- 		values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
-- 		conceal character that will be shown for |hl-Conceal|
-- 		highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
--
-- 			conceal	    Special character to show instead of the
-- 				    match (only for |hl-Conceal| highlighed
-- 				    matches, see |:syn-cchar|)
-- 			window	    Instead of the current window use the
-- 				    window with this number or window ID.
--
-- 		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
-- 		the |:match| commands.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)
--

-- Same as |matchadd()|, but requires a list of positions {pos}
-- 		instead of a pattern. This command is faster than |matchadd()|
-- 		because it does not require to handle regular expressions and
-- 		sets buffer line boundaries to redraw screen. It is supposed
-- 		to be used when fast match additions and deletions are
-- 		required, for example to highlight matching parentheses.
-- 							*E5030* *E5031*
-- 		The list {pos} can contain one of these items:
-- 		- A number.  This whole line will be highlighted.  The first
-- 		  line has number 1.
-- 		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
-- 		  number will be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
-- 		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
-- 		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
-- 		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
-- 		  be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but
-- 		  the third number gives the length of the highlight in bytes.
--
-- 		Entries with zero and negative line numbers are silently
-- 		ignored, as well as entries with negative column numbers and
-- 		lengths.
--
-- 		The maximum number of positions is 8.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchaddpos("MyGroup", [[23, 24], 34])
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)

-- 			coladd		column offset for 'virtualedit'
-- 			lnum		line number
-- 		If buffer {expr} is the current buffer, then the current

-- 		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
-- 		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].
-- 		This is useful to save and restore a |:match|.
-- 		Highlighting matches using the |:match| commands are limited

-- 		  %6s	string right-aligned in 6 bytes
-- 		  %.9s	string truncated to 9 bytes
-- 		  %c	single byte
-- 		  %d	decimal number
-- 		  %5d	decimal number padded with spaces to 5 characters

-- 		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
-- 		  %G	floating point number, as %F or %E depending on value
-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.
--
-- 		i	alias for d
-- 		D	alias for ld
-- 		U	alias for lu
-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.

-- Deletes a match with ID {id} previously defined by |matchadd()|

--
-- 		Example: >
-- 		  :call jobstart('nvim -h', {'on_stdout':{j,d,e->append(line('.'),d)}})
-- <
-- 		Returns |job-id| on success, 0 on invalid arguments (or job
-- 		table is full), -1 if {cmd}[0] or 'shell' is not executable.
-- 		The returned job-id is a valid |channel-id| representing the

--
-- 		See |job-control| and |RPC|.
--
-- 		NOTE: on Windows if {cmd} is a List:

-- <		    If it is a full or partial path, extension is required: >
-- 		      :call jobstart(['System32\ping.exe', 'neovim.io'])

-- 		Return zero if the window cannot be found.
--- @return number

-- Append the item {expr} to |List| {list}.  Returns the

-- 			:let alist = add([1, 2, 3], item)
-- 			:call add(mylist, "woodstock")
-- <		Note that when {expr} is a |List| it is appended as a single
-- 		item.  Use |extend()| to concatenate |Lists|.
-- 		Use |insert()| to add an item at another position.
--- @param list any[]

-- Split {msg} into lines to be displayed in a balloon.  The
-- 		splits are made for the current window size and optimize to
-- 		show debugger output.
-- 		Returns a |List| with the split lines.

--
-- <		{only available when compiled with the |+balloon_eval_term|
-- 		feature}
--- @return list

-- 		split with |balloon_split()|.
-- 		If {expr} is an empty string any existing balloon is removed.

-- 			  call balloon_show(a:result)
-- 			endfunc
-- <		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetText()->balloon_show()
-- <
-- 		The intended use is that fetching the content of the balloon
-- 		is initiated from 'balloonexpr'.  It will invoke an
-- 		asynchronous method, in which a callback invokes
-- 		balloon_show().  The 'balloonexpr' itself can return an
-- 		empty string or a placeholder.

-- Get a single character from the user or input stream.
-- 		If [expr] is omitted, wait until a character is available.
-- 		If [expr] is 0, only get a character when one is available.
-- 			Return zero otherwise.
-- 		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
-- 			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
--
-- 		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
-- 		special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
-- 		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
-- 		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
-- 		For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
-- 		starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
-- 		the String "\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is
-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
-- 		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()
-- 			if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
-- 			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
-- 			  exe v:mouse_lnum
-- 			  exe "normal " . v:mouse_col . "|"
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the
-- 		user that a character has to be typed.
-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character
-- 		sequence.  Examples: >
-- 			getchar() == "\<Del>"
-- 			getchar() == "\<S-Left>"
-- <		This example redefines "f" to ignore case: >
-- 			:nmap f :call FindChar()<CR>
-- 			:function FindChar()
-- 			:  let c = nr2char(getchar())
-- 			:  while col('.') < col('$') - 1
-- 			:    normal l
-- 			:    if getline('.')[col('.') - 1] ==? c

--
-- 		{word} can be a badly spelled word followed by other text.
-- 		This allows for joining two words that were split.  The
-- 		suggestions also include the following text, thus you can
-- 		replace a line.
--
-- 		{word} may also be a good word.  Similar words will then be
-- 		returned.  {word} itself is not included in the suggestions,
-- 		although it may appear capitalized.
--
-- 		The spelling information for the current window is used.  The
-- 		'spell' option must be set and the values of 'spelllang' and

-- Set prompt callback for buffer {buf} to {expr}.  When {expr}
-- 		is an empty string the callback is removed.  This has only
-- 		effect if {buf} has 'buftype' set to "prompt".
--
-- 		The callback is invoked when pressing Enter.  The current
-- 		buffer will always be the prompt buffer.  A new line for a
-- 		prompt is added before invoking the callback, thus the prompt
-- 		for which the callback was invoked will be in the last but one
-- 		line.
-- 		If the callback wants to add text to the buffer, it must
-- 		insert it above the last line, since that is where the current
-- 		prompt is.  This can also be done asynchronously.
-- 		The callback is invoked with one argument, which is the text
-- 		that was entered at the prompt.  This can be an empty string
-- 		if the user only typed Enter.

--
-- 		For the vertical scrollbars {value} can be 1 to the
-- 		line-count of the buffer.  For the horizontal scrollbar the
