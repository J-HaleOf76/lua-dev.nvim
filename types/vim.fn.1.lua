-- 		    core_line	screen line of the text box
-- 		    core_width	width of the text box in screen cells
-- 		    core_height	height of the text box in screen cells
-- 		    firstline	line of the buffer at top (1 unless scrolled)
-- 				(not the value of the "firstline" property)
-- 		    lastline	line of the buffer at the bottom (updated when

-- 		    scrollbar	non-zero if a scrollbar is displayed
-- 		    visible	one if the popup is displayed, zero if hidden
-- 		Note that these are the actual screen positions.  They differ
-- 		from the values in `popup_getoptions()` for the sizing and

--
-- 		The "core_" values exclude the padding and border.
--
-- 		If popup window {id} is not found an empty Dict is returned.

-- 		  %.9s	string truncated to 9 bytes
-- 		  %c	single byte
-- 		  %d	decimal number
-- 		  %5d	decimal number padded with spaces to 5 characters
-- 		  %b	binary number

-- 		  %x	hex number
-- 		  %04x	hex number padded with zeros to at least 4 characters
-- 		  %X	hex number using upper case letters
-- 		  %o	octal number
-- 		  %f	floating point number as 12.23, inf, -inf or nan

-- 		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
-- 		  %G	floating point number, as %F or %E depending on value
-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.
--
-- 		i	alias for d
-- 		D	alias for ld
-- 		U	alias for lu
-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.

-- Set prompt callback for buffer {buf} to {expr}.  When {expr}

-- Search for regexp pattern {pattern}.  The search starts at the

--
-- 		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
-- 		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
-- 		move.  No error message is given.
--
-- 		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'b'	search Backward instead of forward
-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
-- 		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
-- 		    :  normal G$
-- 		    :  let flags = "w"
-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.search(pattern, flags, stopline, timeout) end

-- Search for the declaration of {name}.
--
-- 		With a non-zero {global} argument it works like |gD|, find
-- 		first match in the file.  Otherwise it works like |gd|, find
-- 		first match in the function.
--
-- 		With a non-zero {thisblock} argument matches in a {} block
-- 		that ends before the cursor position are ignored.  Avoids
-- 		finding variable declarations only valid in another scope.
--
-- 		Moves the cursor to the found match.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			if searchdecl('myvar') == 0
-- 			   echo getline('.')
-- 			endif
-- <
-- 							*searchpair()*
-- searchpair({start}, {middle}, {end} [, {flags} [, {skip}
-- 				[, {stopline} [, {timeout}]]]])
-- 		Search for the match of a nested start-end pair.  This can be
-- 		used to find the "endif" that matches an "if", while other
-- 		if/endif pairs in between are ignored.
-- 		The search starts at the cursor.  The default is to search
-- 		forward, include 'b' in {flags} to search backward.
-- 		If a match is found, the cursor is positioned at it and the
-- 		line number is returned.  If no match is found 0 or -1 is
-- 		returned and the cursor doesn't move.  No error message is
-- 		given.
--
-- 		{start}, {middle} and {end} are patterns, see |pattern|.  They
-- 		must not contain \( \) pairs.  Use of \%( \) is allowed.  When
-- 		{middle} is not empty, it is found when searching from either
-- 		direction, but only when not in a nested start-end pair.  A
-- 		typical use is: >
-- 			searchpair('\<if\>', '\<else\>', '\<endif\>')
-- <		By leaving {middle} empty the "else" is skipped.
--
-- 		{flags} 'b', 'c', 'n', 's', 'w' and 'W' are used like with
-- 		|search()|.  Additionally:
-- 		'r'	Repeat until no more matches found; will find the
-- 			outer pair.  Implies the 'W' flag.
-- 		'm'	Return number of matches instead of line number with
-- 			the match; will be > 1 when 'r' is used.
-- 		Note: it's nearly always a good idea to use the 'W' flag, to
-- 		avoid wrapping around the end of the file.
--
-- 		When a match for {start}, {middle} or {end} is found, the
-- 		{skip} expression is evaluated with the cursor positioned on
-- 		the start of the match.  It should return non-zero if this
-- 		match is to be skipped.  E.g., because it is inside a comment
-- 		or a string.
-- 		When {skip} is omitted or empty, every match is accepted.
-- 		When evaluating {skip} causes an error the search is aborted
-- 		and -1 returned.
--  		{skip} can be a string, a lambda, a funcref or a partial.
-- 		Anything else makes the function fail.
--
-- 		For {stopline} and {timeout} see |search()|.
--
-- 		The value of 'ignorecase' is used.  'magic' is ignored, the
-- 		patterns are used like it's on.
--
-- 		The search starts exactly at the cursor.  A match with
-- 		{start}, {middle} or {end} at the next character, in the
-- 		direction of searching, is the first one found.  Example: >
-- 			if 1
-- 			  if 2
-- 			  endif 2
-- 			endif 1
-- <		When starting at the "if 2", with the cursor on the "i", and
-- 		searching forwards, the "endif 2" is found.  When starting on
-- 		the character just before the "if 2", the "endif 1" will be
-- 		found.  That's because the "if 2" will be found first, and
-- 		then this is considered to be a nested if/endif from "if 2" to
-- 		"endif 2".
-- 		When searching backwards and {end} is more than one character,
-- 		it may be useful to put "\zs" at the end of the pattern, so
-- 		that when the cursor is inside a match with the end it finds
-- 		the matching start.
--
-- 		Example, to find the "endif" command in a Vim script: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('\<if\>', '\<el\%[seif]\>', '\<en\%[dif]\>', 'W',
-- 			\ 'getline(".") =~ "^\\s*\""')
--
-- <		The cursor must be at or after the "if" for which a match is
-- 		to be found.  Note that single-quote strings are used to avoid
-- 		having to double the backslashes.  The skip expression only
-- 		catches comments at the start of a line, not after a command.
-- 		Also, a word "en" or "if" halfway through a line is considered
-- 		a match.
-- 		Another example, to search for the matching "{" of a "}": >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW')
--
-- <		This works when the cursor is at or before the "}" for which a
-- 		match is to be found.  To reject matches that syntax
-- 		highlighting recognized as strings: >
--
-- 	:echo searchpair('{', '', '}', 'bW',
-- 	     \ 'synIDattr(synID(line("."), col("."), 0), "name") =~? "string"')
-- <

-- 		column position of the match. The first element of the |List|
-- 		is the line number and the second element is the byte index of
-- 		the column position of the match.  If no match is found,
-- 		returns [0, 0]. >

-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,

-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the

--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is '1' or 'i' then case is
-- 		ignored.
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'n' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical (Implementation detail: This uses the

-- 		Funcrefs will be considered as being 0).
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'N' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical. This is like 'n' but a string containing
-- 		digits will be used as the number they represent.
--
-- 		When {func} is given and it is 'f' then all items will be
-- 		sorted numerical. All values must be a Number or a Float.
--
-- 		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function
-- 		is called to compare items.  The function is invoked with two
-- 		items as argument and must return zero if they are equal, 1 or
-- 		bigger if the first one sorts after the second one, -1 or
-- 		smaller if the first one sorts before the second one.
--
-- 		{dict} is for functions with the "dict" attribute.  It will be
-- 		used to set the local variable "self". |Dictionary-function|
--
-- 		The sort is stable, items which compare equal (as number or as
-- 		string) will keep their relative position. E.g., when sorting
-- 		on numbers, text strings will sort next to each other, in the
-- 		same order as they were originally.
--

-- Convert String {expr} to a Float.  This mostly works the same
-- 		as when using a floating point number in an expression, see
-- 		|floating-point-format|.  But it's a bit more permissive.
-- 		E.g., "1e40" is accepted, while in an expression you need to
-- 		write "1.0e40".  The hexadecimal form "0x123" is also
-- 		accepted, but not others, like binary or octal.
-- 		Text after the number is silently ignored.
-- 		The decimal point is always '.', no matter what the locale is
-- 		set to.  A comma ends the number: "12,345.67" is converted to
-- 		12.0.  You can strip out thousands separators with

-- 		with the default String to Number conversion.
-- 		When {base} is 16 a leading "0x" or "0X" is ignored.  With a

-- 		Examples: >

--
-- 		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
-- 		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
-- 		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
-- 		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
-- 		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
-- 		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
-- 		used.
--
-- 		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
-- 		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
-- 		|sub-replace-special|.  For example, to replace something with
-- 		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.
--
-- 		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
-- 		unmodified.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
-- <		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
-- 			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
-- <		results in "TESTING".
--
-- 		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as

--
-- <		When {sub} is a Funcref that function is called, with one

-- 			endfor
-- <		Note that a buffer may appear in more than one window.

-- 			$	the number of the last tab page (the tab page
-- 				count).
-- 			#	the number of the last accessed tab page (where
-- 				|g<Tab>| goes to).  If there is no previous

-- 		- When omitted the current window number is returned.  This is
-- 		  the window which will be used when going to this tab page.
-- 		- When "$" the number of windows is returned.
-- 		- When "#" the previous window nr is returned.
-- 		Useful examples: >

--
-- 		If {filename} is passed it is used to prioritize the results
-- 		in the same way that |:tselect| does. See |tag-priority|.
-- 		{filename} should be the full path of the file.
--
-- 		Each list item is a dictionary with at least the following
-- 		entries:
-- 			name		Name of the tag.
-- 			filename	Name of the file where the tag is
-- 					defined.  It is either relative to the
-- 					current directory or a full path.
-- 			cmd		Ex command used to locate the tag in
-- 					the file.
-- 			kind		Type of the tag.  The value for this
-- 					entry depends on the language specific
-- 					kind values.  Only available when
-- 					using a tags file generated by
-- 					Exuberant ctags or hdrtag.
-- 			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to
-- 					|static-tag| for more information.
-- 		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
-- 		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
-- 		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
-- 		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
-- 		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is
-- 		contained in.
--
-- 		The ex-command "cmd" can be either an ex search pattern, a
-- 		line number or a line number followed by a byte number.
--
-- 		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.
--
-- 		To get an exact tag match, the anchors '^' and '$' should be
-- 		used in {expr}.  This also make the function work faster.
-- 		Refer to |tag-regexp| for more information about the tag
-- 		search regular expression pattern.
--
-- 		Refer to |'tags'| for information about how the tags file is
-- 		located by Vim. Refer to |tags-file-format| for the format of
-- 		the tags file generated by the different ctags tools.

-- 		Returns the buffer number or zero when the diff fails.
-- 		Also see |terminal-diff|.
-- 		NOTE: this does not work with double-width characters yet.
--
-- 		The top part of the buffer contains the contents of the first

-- 		the second file.  The middle part shows the differences.
-- 		The parts are separated by a line of equals.
--
-- 		If the {options} argument is present, it must be a Dict with
-- 		these possible members:

-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "term_cols"	     horizontal size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically
-- 		   "curwin"	     use the current window, do not split the
-- 				     window; fails if the current buffer
-- 				     cannot be |abandon|ed
-- 		   "bufnr"	     do not create a new buffer, use the
-- 				     existing buffer "bufnr".  This buffer
-- 				     must have been previously created with
-- 				     term_dumpdiff() or term_dumpload() and
-- 				     visible in a window.
-- 		   "norestore"	     do not add the terminal window to a
-- 				     session file
--
-- 		Each character in the middle part indicates a difference. If
-- 		there are multiple differences only the first in this list is
-- 		used:
-- 			X	different character
-- 			w	different width
-- 			f	different foreground color
-- 			b	different background color
-- 			a	different attribute
-- 			+	missing position in first file
-- 			-	missing position in second file
--
-- 		Using the "s" key the top and bottom parts are swapped.  This
-- 		makes it easy to spot a difference.

-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.
-- 		   "term_opencmd"    command to use for opening the window when
-- 				     "open" is used for "term_finish"; must
-- 				     have "%d" where the buffer number goes,
-- 				     e.g. "10split|buffer %d"; when not

-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		   "tty_type"	     (MS-Windows only): Specify which pty to

-- window.  The top window has number 1.

-- 		The optional argument {arg} supports the following values:
-- 			$	the number of the last window (the window
-- 				count).
-- 			#	the number of the last accessed window (where
-- 				|CTRL-W_p| goes to).  If there is no previous
-- 				window or it is in another tab page 0 is
-- 				returned.
-- 			{N}j	the number of the Nth window below the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_j| goes to).
-- 			{N}k	the number of the Nth window above the current
-- 				window (where |CTRL-W_k| goes to).
-- 			{N}h	the number of the Nth window left of the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_h| goes to).
-- 			{N}l	the number of the Nth window right of the
-- 				current window (where |CTRL-W_l| goes to).
-- 		The number can be used with |CTRL-W_w| and ":wincmd w"
-- 		|:wincmd|.
-- 		Also see |tabpagewinnr()| and |win_getid()|.

-- 			let prev_window = winnr('#')
-- 			let wnum = winnr('3k')

-- 		wants to move on vertical movements) of the cursor to column 5
-- 		(yes, that is 5), while all other settings will remain the
-- 		same. This is useful, if you set the cursor position manually.
--
-- 		If you have changed the values the result is unpredictable.
-- 		If the window size changed the result won't be the same.

-- the view of the current window.  Use |winrestview()| to
-- 		restore the view.
-- 		This is useful if you have a mapping that jumps around in the
-- 		buffer and you want to go back to the original view.
-- 		This does not save fold information.  Use the 'foldenable'
-- 		option to temporarily switch off folding, so that folds are
-- 		not opened when moving around. This may have side effects.
-- 		The return value includes:
-- 			lnum		cursor line number
-- 			col		cursor column (Note: the first column
-- 					zero, as opposed to what getpos()
-- 					returns)
-- 			coladd		cursor column offset for 'virtualedit'
-- 			curswant	column for vertical movement
-- 			topline		first line in the window
-- 			topfill		filler lines, only in diff mode
-- 			leftcol		first column displayed
-- 			skipcol		columns skipped
-- 		Note that no option values are saved.

-- The result is a Number, which is the width of window {nr}.
-- 		{nr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the width of the current window is

-- 		An existing window always has a width of zero or more.

--   :  50 wincmd |
--   :endif
-- <		For getting the terminal or screen size, see the 'columns'

-- Write |List| {list} to file {fname}.  Each list item is
-- 		separated with a NL.  Each list item must be a String or
-- 		Number.
-- 		When {flags} contains "b" then binary mode is used: There will
-- 		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
-- 		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.
--
-- 		When {flags} contains "a" then append mode is used, lines are
-- 		appended to the file: >
-- 			:call writefile(["foo"], "event.log", "a")
-- 			:call writefile(["bar"], "event.log", "a")
-- <
-- 		When {flags} contains "S" fsync() call is not used, with "s"
-- 		it is used, 'fsync' option applies by default. No fsync()
-- 		means that writefile() will finish faster, but writes may be
-- 		left in OS buffers and not yet written to disk. Such changes
-- 		will disappear if system crashes before OS does writing.
--
-- 		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
-- 		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
-- 		to writefile().
-- 		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
-- 		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
-- 		error message if the file can't be created or when writing
-- 		fails.
-- 		Also see |readfile()|.

-- 			:let fl = readfile("foo", "b")
-- 			:call writefile(fl, "foocopy", "b")
